/**
 * prompt-examples — every worked example in every prompt this pass sends, run
 * through the validator that will judge the model's real answers.
 *
 * A PORT, whole and unabridged, of BookForge's
 * `tools/test-prompt-examples.js`. That script is entirely pure — it parses two
 * prompt .txt files and runs each example through `validateNumberEdits` — so
 * nothing was left behind here. Every assertion is the one that was written
 * there.
 *
 * ── Why this suite exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The adversarial review of 2026-09-04 ran the shipped few-shot answers through
 * `validateNumberEdits` and found the demonstration was three-quarters refused:
 *
 *   [APPLIED]            "Henry VIII"   -> "Henry the Eighth"
 *   [REPLACE_NOT_WORDS]  "waited - and" -> "waited—and"     (no em dash in SPOKEN_BASE)
 *   [REPLACE_NOT_WORDS]  "waited - for" -> "waited—for"
 *   [NOT_FOUND]          "he SAID he"   -> "he said he"     (not verbatim in its own target)
 *
 * A prompt that teaches a shape the validator refuses categorically is a whole
 * class of the pass that can never produce an accepted edit — and because the
 * model pass costs a GPU, nobody sees it until a book has been paid for. This
 * suite is what catches it with no GPU at all: the prompt and the validator have
 * to agree, and here is where they are made to.
 *
 * It parses the prompt FILES rather than a copy, so a future edit to an example
 * is judged the moment it is written. `src/clean/prompt.ts` embeds the same two
 * files with `{ type: 'text' }`; reading them off disk here is the same bytes
 * and is what the original did.

 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, and why the loop above cannot see it.
 *
 * Every reading the prompt states is run through the validator above — and the
 * validator accepts BOTH scripture forms, the comma alone and the word "verse",
 * because a narrator uses both. So a prompt that asks for the minority form
 * passes every check on this branch and the `--scripture` probe too (it scores
 * `accept.some(...)`, and the comma form is in every `accept` list). The
 * adversarial review of 2026-09-05 found exactly that: the docs, the fixtures
 * and the tests all said "verse" and the prompt said "PREFER the comma", so a
 * real render would have shipped the 1-of-23 reading with everything green.
 *
 * What is asserted here is therefore not whether a reading is ACCEPTABLE but
 * which one the prompt PREFERS — which is the only thing that decides what the
 * narrator actually says.
 *
 * THE MEASUREMENT: whisper over the 23 scripture references carrying numbers in
 * the deathstalker corpus (E:\training\deathstalker\build\ds_ad4s\
 * scripture_spoken_forms_report.txt, 2026-09-05) — 22 of 23 say "verse" or
