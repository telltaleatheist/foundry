/**
 * text-edits — the reading law, and the spans the punctuation stage hands the
 * writer.
 *
 * A PORT of the PURE half of BookForge's `tools/test-narration-text-pass.js`:
 * every test driven by its `verdictOf` helper (the whole text-edit invariant
 * table — R3-*, F1-F5, NF1-NF2, `classifyEdit`, the budgets and the caps) and
 * every test driven by `punctuationSpans`. The assertions are that file's,
 * unchanged.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS LEFT BEHIND, and why ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The fifteen tests built on that script's `buildBook()` helper. They zip a
 * synthetic EPUB and run `runNarrationTextPass` over it end to end — the three
 * stages in order, the text-only invariant, the caption's place, the receipt,
 * the stamp and `narrationTextGate`'s missing/stale/current answers,
 * idempotence, preformatted refusal, the in-place refusal, the untouched
 * input, and "every block is asked". Every one of them needs an EPUB document
 * tree and the pass that walks it, and this engine has neither: there is no
 * EPUB narration pass here, no `epub-processor` ZipWriter, no stamp and no
 * gate. Porting them would mean inventing the thing they test, which is not a
 * port.
 *
 * ONE OF THEM SURVIVES IN SUBSTITUTED FORM. `a span that would cross an <em>
 * is REFUSED` is the claim this engine's marker rule still depends on, and it
 * is answerable without a zip: a span straddling a segment boundary must come
 * back SPANS_MARKUP. It is named as the substitute it is, below.
