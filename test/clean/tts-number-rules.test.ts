/**
 * The deterministic number rules — the shapes code reads before the model is
 * asked anything.
 *
 * A PORT, not a rewrite. This file is `tools/test-tts-number-rules.js` from
 * BookForge, carried across when `src/clean/tts-number-rules.ts` came here.
 * Foundry now OWNS these rules, so Foundry owns the record of what they promise:
 * a suite that stayed behind in the repo that no longer holds the code would
 * have gone green forever on a copy nobody edits. Every case and every assertion
 * below is the BookForge one, verbatim — the harness changed, the claims did
 * not, because a ported assertion that was quietly relaxed is worse than no port
 * at all.
 *
 * ── What is worth defending here ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE GUARANTEE. Owen admitted these rules on one condition — *"just basic
 * deterministic stuff that we can guarantee will be correct on the other side"*
 * — so every rule below is pinned to the exact reading it promises, and every
 * shape the rules are NOT allowed to touch is pinned to coming out byte for byte
 * as it went in. A rule that quietly widened its net would be a defect the
 * record cannot show, because a rule edit is never refused for being wrong.
 *
 * THE MEASURED FAILURES. Every scripture case here is a span the 9b model got
 * WRONG on the 2026-09-02 run (record:
 * `narration-cuts/d7542db2804b8354.n1.qwen3.5-9b.norm.tts.edits.json`) —
 * "Jeremiah 44:17-19" as "four fourteen seventeen", "Daniel 4:33" as "four three
 * three", "Revelation 9:20–21" with the 20 dropped. Those are the reason the
 * pre-pass exists and they are the reason it is tested here by name.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCE, because the rules run over a book that may already have been
 * through them (a re-prep, a heading reconciled against its contents entry), and
 * a rule that re-read its own output would compound.
 *
 * THE OFFSETS AND THE TEXT NODES, because the pass downstream splices by offset
 * into the ORIGINAL text and refuses a span that would flatten an `<em>`.
 *
 * Pure functions all the way down: no model, no GPU, no files.

/**
 * THE CONTRACT THESE TESTS DEFEND, and how it changed on 2026-09-05.
 *
 * Until n6 the rules READ a reference: "2 Cor. 10:4" came out "Second
 * Corinthians ten four", from a table of book abbreviations. Owen ended that
 * after a Higgs A/B render narrated "(1 Pet. 3:7)" as *"one pet three seven"*:
 * "I don't want to do it deterministically. An AI takes over. There are a
 * billion ways Bible verses are abbreviated."
 *
 * So the assertion changed shape. What is pinned now is:
 *
 *   DETECTION — the span is recognized, and recognized WHOLE. Half a reference
 *   protected is worse than none, because the unprotected half is what the
 *   integer rule reads, and "one pet three seven" is what that sounds like.
 *
 *   PROTECTION — the text comes back byte for byte. Every digit is still there
 *   when the model is asked, which is the only reason the model can read it.
 *
 *   THE MUST-NOT LIST — Owen's own, 2026-09-05, plus everything the adversarial
 *   review measured firing that day, one test per case. A detector is a claim
 *   about text the app does not own, and the cases it must NOT claim are the ones
 *   that say whether the claim is honest.
 *
 *   AND WHAT A MISS COSTS. A false positive is NOT free, which is the finding
 *   that produced the evidence test: inside a detected span the validator asks
 *   for a chapter-and-verse pause, so a detection on "Widescreen 16:9" made the
 *   correct reading unrepresentable — and the book-less rule, which read "Score
 *   21:19" correctly on main, never got the chance. So every must-NOT case below
 *   pins BOTH halves: nothing detected, and the reading main gave it, byte for
 *   byte.
 *
 * The READING lives in `src/clean/prompts/tts-number-normalize.txt` and is
 * measured against `test/clean/fixtures/scripture-readings.json` — sixty-six
 * books and the deuterocanon — by the Ollama-gated probe that judges the model.
