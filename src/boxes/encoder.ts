/**
 * boxes encoder — turn a book's OCR blocks into the exact prompt the
 * block-category model was fine-tuned on.
 *
 * Moved verbatim from BookForgeApp
 * `src/app/features/pdf-picker/services/rubric-encoder.ts` (MIGRATION §1). The
 * symbols are renamed rubric→boxes; NOTHING about what this file emits or
 * accepts has changed, and `tools/replay-boxes.mjs` proves it by diffing the
 * prompts both implementations produce for real labelled books, byte for byte.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS A CONTRACT, not a convenience. The model was trained by
 * BookForgeApp `tools/aligner/build-sft-dataset.mjs`, and a fine-tune only
 * performs on the format it saw: a renamed field or a decimal place in the wrong
 * position degrades it in ways that look exactly like a bad model. If you change
 * the format here, change it there, and regenerate the fixtures; a red replay
 * means the model is about to get input it has never seen.
 *
 * Three formats are supported because three adapters exist. v1 is the first
 * run's checkpoint (geometry, font ratio, gap above); v2 adds the features that
 * run built to fix — gap below, envelope-relative position, the width/centre
 * decomposition, and cross-page repetition — and encodes every quantity as a
 * small integer, since decimals cost three to four tokens apiece.
 *
 * v3 changes the TAXONOMY, not the features: it is v2's block line exactly,
 * with `front_matter`, `back_matter` and `footnote_ref` retired. The first two
 * were assigned by a positional rule rather than by what the block is, and
 * between them they covered 18% of the corpus — swallowing the headings, titles
 * and lists that happened to sit in those page ranges. Every one of those blocks
 * was relabelled by hand. So a v3 prompt and a v2 prompt differ in exactly one
 * line, and feeding a v2 adapter the v3 category list (or the reverse) hands it
 * a legal-looking prompt advertising classes it never saw.
 *
 * EVERY NORMALIZER IS DERIVED WITHOUT LABELS, which is what makes inference
 * possible at all: the book is OCR'd in full before anything is classified, so
 * the modal type size, the modal leading, the text envelope, the body measure
 * and the repetition rates are all available up front — the same quantities,
 * computed the same way, as during training.
