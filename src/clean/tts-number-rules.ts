/**
 * tts-number-rules.ts — the shapes a narrator's reading is GUARANTEED, done in
 * code before the model is ever asked.
 *
 * ── The ruling this file exists for ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Owen, 2026-09-02, after the first live run of the number pass read
 * "Jeremiah 44:17-19" as "four fourteen seventeen…" and narrated the word
 * "hyphen" forty times: *"lets try doing deterministic scripture fixing since we
 * know that shape. have it do the deterministic part before sending it through
 * to the ai, so the ai has less work to do. we can probably do some basic
 * deterministic stuff… just basic deterministic stuff that we can GUARANTEE will
 * be correct on the other side, then send everything else through the ai."*
 *
 * GUARANTEE is the whole admission test. A shape belongs here only when the
 * printed form has exactly one spoken reading and the rule can prove it is
 * looking at that shape. Everything else — a bare four-digit number (year or
 * quantity), a decimal with no unit, a slash reference, a page citation, a roman
 * numeral, digits glued to letters — is LEFT AS PRINTED for the model, which is
 * the pass that exists to weigh context. A rule that is 95% right is not a rule;
 * it is a defect with a schedule.
 *
 * ── Where the readings come from ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The cardinal and the scripture forms are a port of e2a's
 * `lib/classes/tts_engines/common/orpheus_text.py` (`num_to_words`,
 * `_big_num_words`, `expand_grouped_integers`, `normalize_scripture`), which is
 * itself the training-corpus extractor's transform — so the words the fine-tunes
 * were trained on and the words this pass hands them are one form. Owen,
 * 2026-09-02: *"pull the logic right out of e2a and place it in bookforge… it
 * belongs in bookforge."* e2a is not edited; this is the copy that runs.
 *
 * The style, which the two halves do NOT share and must not be "tidied" into
 * agreement:
 *   - CARDINALS are unhyphenated and carry no "and": 250 is "two hundred fifty",
 *     44 is "forty four", 3,450 is "three thousand four hundred fifty".
 *   - ORDINALS and PAIR-FORM YEARS are hyphenated: "twenty-third", "nineteen
 *     forty-four", "nineteen oh five", "two thousand six". Those come from
 *     number-expansion.ts, which already reads them that way.
 *   - DATES are American in BOTH printed orders: "June 12, 1933" and
 *     "12 June 1933" are each "June twelfth, nineteen thirty-three".
 *   - A verse RANGE is "through", the form the training corpora print.
 *
 * ── What it returns, and why offsets ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Edits, not a rewritten string. The pass downstream has to know exactly which
 * spans code changed so a model edit that overlaps one can be refused and the
 * rest mapped back to the ORIGINAL text; and an edit must sit inside ONE of the
 * target's text nodes or it would flatten an `<em>`. Both are answerable only
 * with offsets, so offsets are what this returns. The applied text comes back
 * too, because the caller needs the exact string the model will be shown.
 *
 * Doctrine, from the pass above it: pure functions only. No fs, no model, no
 * Electron. Every rule is reachable from a test with no GPU.

/**
 * THE RULING THIS SECTION EXISTS FOR, and what it replaced.
 *
 * Owen, 2026-09-05, after a Higgs A/B render of the deathstalker book narrated
 * "(1 Pet. 3:7)" as *"one pet three seven"*: **"I don't want to do it
 * deterministically. An AI takes over. There are a billion ways Bible verses are
 * abbreviated."**
 *
 * Until n6 this file carried a table of ABBREVIATIONS and READ the reference
 * itself — "2 Cor. 10:4" → "Second Corinthians ten four". An abbreviation table
 * is the wrong instrument for an open set: "Pet.", "1 Pt.", "I Pet." and a
 * hundred house styles are one book, and a table that is 95% complete does not
 * read the last 5% as printed — it hands them to the generic integer rule, which
 * narrates "one pet three seven". That is the defect Owen heard.
 *
 * So the deterministic layer does the one thing it can GUARANTEE: it recognizes
 * the SHAPE of a reference and PROTECTS it. Nothing rewrites a detected span.
 * The span keeps its digits, which is what routes its block to the model, and
 * the model reads it (`electron/prompts/tts-number-normalize.txt`).
 *
 * ── WHAT COUNTS AS EVIDENCE, and why a false positive is not free ───────────
 *
 * The first cut of this detector fired on ANY capitalized token in front of a
 * `c:v`, on the theory that "a span detected in error is merely sent to the
 * model". THAT WAS MEASURED FALSE (adversarial review, 2026-09-05): inside a
 * detected span the validator demands a pause between chapter and verse, so the
 * model's CORRECT reading of "Widescreen 16:9" → *"sixteen nine"* was refused
 * and the digits reached the narrator — and the book-less rule, which read
 * "Score 21:19" correctly before this branch, no longer got the chance. The
 * deny-list that was supposed to hold the line ("Chapter", "Room", …) is not a
 * closed set and never could be: `Lakers`, `Widescreen`, `Flight`, `Route`,
 * `Docket`, `BWV`, every weekday and a sentence-initial `Then` all fired.
 *
 * So detection now requires EVIDENCE, and there are exactly four kinds — three
 * strong, one weak and paid for below. A reference is detected when the token in
 * front of the `c:v` is:
 *
 *   (a) an ABBREVIATION — it carries its own period: "Pet. 3:7", "Ps. 63:6";
 *   (b) preceded by a VOLUME NUMBER — arabic 1-3, roman I/II/III, or the
 *       ordinal forms: "1 John 3:16", "II Cor. 5:17", "1st John 1:9";
 *   (c) one of the FULL CANONICAL BOOK NAMES below;
 *   (d) TWO OR THREE LETTERS with no period at all: "Ps 23:1", "Jn 3:16",
 *       "Rev 21:4", "Mt 5:3".
 *
 * Everything else keeps exactly the behaviour it had before this branch.
 *
 * ── (d) IS WEAK EVIDENCE, ON PURPOSE, AND IT IS CHEAP BECAUSE OF THE CLAIM TEST
 *
 * A dotless "Ps 23:1" is the same shape as "Map 2:1" and "Bus 47:15", so on its
 * own it proves nothing. It is admitted anyway because the FIRST cut of (a)-(c)
 * left every dotless abbreviation unreadable — the model's "Psalm twenty three,
 * verse one" was refused WORDS_DROPPED, because that relaxation is scoped to
 * detected spans, and the digits reached the narrator. Losing "Ps", "Jn", "Rev"
 * and "Mt" is a regression from this app's own behaviour in exactly the domain
 * the branch exists for.
 *
 * What makes it affordable is the validator's CLAIM TEST, which is the same
 * thing that makes a detected "Sec. 3:7" affordable: the chapter-and-verse pause
 * is asked only of a reading that NAMES a canonical book or an ordinal volume.
 * So "Map 2:1" → "Map two one" and "Bus 47:15" → "Bus forty seven fifteen" are
 * accepted exactly as printed prose, while "Jn 3:16" → "John three, verse
 * sixteen" is accepted as a reference. The model decides which it is looking at,
 * which is the arrangement Owen ruled for.
 *
 * THE COST, stated so it is not a surprise: a 2-3 letter token in front of a
 * c:v is now PROTECTED, so the book-less rule no longer reads it, and its
 * reading depends on the model where before it was deterministic. Measured, the
 * surface is small — a token of exactly two or three letters, no period, with a
 * verse of ten or more ("Bus 47:15"). Four letters and up are deliberately out:
 * "Then", "Score", "Case", "Odds", "Route" and every longer word keep the
 * deterministic reading they have on main.
 *
 * ── THE SAME VETO NOTE AS (c) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * (d) is not a table of abbreviations either — it asks the token's LENGTH, not
 * its identity — but it is the loosest of the four, and it is the one to remove
 * first if Owen wants the detector tighter. Deleting it restores (a)-(c) exactly
 * and costs the dotless abbreviations again.
 *
 * ── THE READING OF OWEN'S RULING THAT (c) RESTS ON — HE MAY VETO IT ─────────
 *
 * Owen's objection was to enumerating ABBREVIATIONS ("there are a billion ways
 * Bible verses are abbreviated"), and it is unanswerable: that set is open, and
 * every house style invents another. The set of full canonical book names is
 * neither open nor invented — it is 73 fixed words, closed since the canon was,
 * and it is used here as a SHAPE, never as a reading. If Owen reads his ruling
 * as forbidding this list too, delete `CANONICAL_BOOK_NAMES` and shapes (a) and
 * (b) still stand; the cost is that "Genesis 3:15" and "Revelation 21:4" — a
 * fully spelled book with no volume number — stop being protected.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NOT DETECTED, stated so it is not mistaken for an oversight ─────
 *
 * A SINGLE-LETTER ABBREVIATION: "S. of S. 2:1". The token pattern needs two
 * letters, because a one-letter abbreviation is also every initial in a name.
 *
 * A LONGER DOTLESS WORD: "Widescreen 16:9", "Score 21:19", "Wednesday 9:45",
 * "Then 9:45". Four letters and up with no period is the shape of every
 * capitalized noun in English, and (d) stops short of it deliberately.
 *
 * The book table itself survives as TEST EVIDENCE for the model —
 * `tools/fixtures/scripture-readings.json`.
