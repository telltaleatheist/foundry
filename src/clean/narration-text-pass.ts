/**
 * narration-text-pass.ts — the narration text cleanup, as ONE step the user runs
 * and the book remembers.
 *
 * ── The ruling this file exists for ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Owen, 2026-09-04: *"We should make this its own intentional step that the user
 * runs and persists, so we don't have to run it again. It runs the step on an
 * epub that foundry exported/completed and it creates an updated epub. This
 * should be a foundry step that's necessary before it goes to TTS."*
 *
 * Until now the text cleaning happened INSIDE the render door
 * (`prepareNarrationInput`), on a content-addressed scratch copy nobody could
 * see, once per render, and — for the punctuation half — not at all. So a book
 * that was never `--ai-cleanup`ed reached the voice with its curly quotes and
 * its printed ellipses intact, and an hour of model time on the numbers was
 * spent again every time the render's input changed by a byte.
 *
 * This is that work, moved onto the document chain beside simplify, translate
 * and the footnote-reference strip: a pass the user queues, that writes a new
 * book, that is recorded in the ledger with a reviewable receipt, and that
 * STAMPS the book so every consumer downstream can tell it ran.
 *
 * ── The three stages, in this order, and the order is load-bearing ──────────
 *
 *   1. PUNCTUATION — `electron/tts-punctuation.ts`, spec s1. The canonical
 *      ellipsis, the quote map, the invisibles, the space variants. Pure and
 *      instant.
 *   2. THE NUMBER RULES — `electron/tts-number-rules.ts`. The shapes a narrator's
 *      reading is GUARANTEED, done in code.
 *   3. THE MODEL, on the residue — `electron/tts-number-normalizer.ts`. Its
 *      validators, its retry rules, its parse-failure gate, its record. NOT
 *      forked: stages 2 and 3 are that module, called with the punctuated book.
 *
 * Punctuation must run FIRST and cannot run last: `normalizeQuotes` turning a
 * U+2026 into "..." after `applyNumberRules` had computed offsets would
 * invalidate every one of them.
 *
 * ── Why the two stages are two WRITES and not one ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Stage 1 produces offsets into the printed book; stages 2-3 produce offsets
 * into the punctuated one, and the number rules' own `find` strings routinely
 * contain characters stage 1 created (`"250 members` opens with a quote the
 * printed book set curly). Composing the two into one rewrite list against the
 * printed text would mean either refusing every number that stands next to a
 * canonicalized quote, or hand-merging overlapping spans — a second coordinate
 * system to keep true. So stage 1 writes a book and stages 2-3 read it. Each
 * write is `writeNarrationEpub`, which proves every rewrite landed or destroys
 * its output; the intermediate is content-addressed and reused.
 *
 * ── Text only, and the book keeps everything ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `excludeCaptions`, `excludeFootnotes` and `stripSupMarkers` are all OFF here,
 * against `writeNarrationEpub`'s own defaults. This pass edits THE BOOK, on the
 * chain, so it may change TEXT and must never add, remove or reorder an element
 * — a pass that failed that would move every narration strike the user ever made
 * onto the wrong paragraph. The caption/endnote/marker cut stays where it is: in
 * the render door, on the second file, which is what it always was.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY ENFORCES IT, stated exactly, because an earlier draft of this
 * comment credited two checks that are weaker than it claimed (the adversarial
 * review, 2026-09-04): `verifyNarrationCarry` answers "nothing to carry" for a
 * book with no strike record, and `registerLedgerPass`'s own check compares
 * element COUNTS per file, runs after the book has been replaced, and degrades
 * to a warning. The real guarantee is `writeNarrationEpub`'s own accounting —
 * every element accounted for, every rewrite proved to have landed against the
 * file on disk, the output destroyed on mismatch — cross-checked here by
 * `punctuateBook`'s `written.rewrittenSpans === spansApplied`. The two ledger
 * checks are what CARRY the strikes and RECORD the row; they are not the wall.

/**
 * The character spans that turn `before` into `after`, at their offsets in

 *
 * `diffChars` from the `diff` package — the same library `computeCompactDiff`
 * uses for the pass diffs — grouped so that a removal and the insertion beside
 * it are ONE replacement rather than two edits at the same offset. The offsets
 * are in the BEFORE text because that is the text the book prints and the writer
 * splices into.
 *
 * A PURE INSERTION is possible, and this used to throw on it, blaming a
 * condition the author had declared impossible. The rules are innocent — they
 * only delete and replace — but `diffChars` chooses a different minimal
 * alignment when a deletion sits near a run of identically-replaced glyphs, and
 * emits an insertion group. `"a\u00adb \u201cc\u201d\u00a0d "` is enough: a soft
 * hyphen, two curly quotes, an NBSP and a trailing space in one short string.
 * Long prose gives the differ unique anchors and never trips it; the pass also
 * collects SHORT targets — nav anchors, NCX labels, the OPF title, headings —
 * which is exactly the regime where it does (the adversarial review, 2026-09-04:
 * 40,027 of 386,344 fuzzed strings).
 *
 * So an insertion is ABSORBED into the character beside it, which is always
 * well defined and preserves the canonical text exactly: an insertion at `p`
 * becomes a replacement of `text[p-1]` by itself plus the inserted characters
 * (or of `text[0]` when there is nothing before it). Nothing throws, and a span
 * that then turns out to cross a text node is refused like any other.
