/**
 * The step ledger — a project's history as a tree that a person reads as a list.
 *
 * ── The failure this exists to prevent ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Photoshop's History panel truncates. Step back three states, do anything at
 * all, and the three states after it are gone — which is correct for a filter
 * applied to pixels that can be applied again in a second, and catastrophic
 * here. Every payload in this app is hours of GPU or hours of a person's
 * judgement: a readings bank is a vision model over three hundred pages, a
 * translation is a model over every block of the book, a curation snapshot is
 * somebody's decisions about four hundred blocks. Truncating that history is
 * throwing away the only copies of things nobody can cheaply make again, in
 * response to a gesture — clicking an earlier row — that every user of every
 * history panel believes is free.
 *
 * So this one APPENDS. Every step records which step it was made FROM, and
 * acting while standing on an earlier step adds a step whose parent is the one
 * you were standing on. Translate to English, click back to the reading,
 * translate to Hungarian: the ledger reads import → reading → English →
 * Hungarian, Hungarian last because it happened last, its parent the reading.
 * Nothing was lost and nothing was asked.
 *
 * ── Structurally a tree, experientially a ledger ────────────────────────────
 *
 * That parent chain makes this a tree, and a tree UI would be the wrong answer
 * to a question nobody asked: people do not want to reason about a graph of
 * their book, they want to see what they have done and click back to any of it.
 * So `chronological` is the shape the UI gets — a flat list in creation order —
 * and the ONE concession to the tree is a quiet "from Read" on a row whose
 * parent is not the row immediately above it. A project worked straight through
 * has no annotations at all.
 *
 * ── Why every function here is pure ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Deleting a step destroys payload files; a re-run destroys the payload it
 * replaces; the migration rewrites the shape of every project on every user's
 * disk. That is the code in this app most worth covering with tests, and the
 * code that historically could not be reached by one, because it lived beside
 * `import { app } from 'electron'` (see the header of shared/steps.ts, which is
 * the same lesson learned the same way). So: no `fs`, no `path`, no `electron`,
 * no clock, no randomness. This module maps a ledger to a ledger, and answers
 * questions about one. Everything that touches a disk — reading the manifest,
 * unlinking the payloads a delete named, swapping a bank in on success — is the
 * main process's job, and stays there.
 *
 * `parseLedger` takes `unknown` rather than text for the same reason: reading a
 * file is the caller's business, including whatever it does about byte-order
 * marks and torn writes. This module's business starts at "here is a value that
 * claims to be a ledger", and its answer is either the ledger or a refusal that
 * names what is wrong with it.
 *
 * ── And the refusals are strict ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This file is written whole by one program, so anything wrong with it is a
 * bug in that program — and a ledger half-read is worse than no ledger at all.
 * A step whose parent id is a typo, guessed at, is a book whose history says it
 * was translated from a reading it was not translated from. Every refusal names
 * the row and the field, so that the person who has to fix it can.

 * a German book plainly and saying it in easy language are two books for two

/**
 * Params the RUN MINTED rather than params the run was ASKED FOR.
 *
 * ── The bug this table is the fix for ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A re-run is "the same action, the same parameters, the same parent", and a
 * re-run means REPLACE. Read the same pages again and the new bank swaps in for
 * the old one; read a different book, or read from a different step, and it is a
 * new branch. That rule is the whole of `reRunTarget`.
 *
 * Compare a reading's params naively and the rule inverts itself. A re-read
 * MINTS A NEW GENERATION — that is what a generation is for, it is the app's
 * defence against amendments from a previous pass naming blocks in this one
 * (see `ProjectReading`) — so the second reading's `generation` never equals the
 * first's, no comparison ever matches, and every re-read appends a second
 * reading beside the one it was meant to replace. The user asked to read the
 * book again and got two banks, one of them stale, forever.
 *
 * So the comparison is over what was ASKED, and the generation is what came
 * back. The distinction is worth having a name for because it will come up
 * again: any params field a job STAMPS on its own answer belongs here.
 *
 * ── And `pages` is the field that proved it was a table ─────────────────────
 *
 * A page count is COUNTED OFF THE BANK AFTER THE RUN — `recordReading` counts the
 * lines in the file the engine wrote — so it is an answer in exactly the way a
 * generation is, and it sat in the question's pile for one release because it
 * ALMOST WORKS THERE. Two readings of one book usually produce the same count, so
 * a re-read usually matched the step it was meant to replace, and the count acted
 * as a proxy for "the same page range". The cases where the proxy fails are the
 * expensive ones and they fail silently:
 *
 *   A RE-READ WITH DIFFERENT `--skip-pages` produced a different count and so
 *   BRANCHED — leaving two `read` steps both naming the single
 *   `readings/<key>.jsonl` the engine writes, the older of them describing a bank
 *   that has since been archived out from under it. Two steps, one payload, and a
 *   row that renders somebody else's reading.
 *
 *   A RUN RESUMED after dying at page 200 landed with a bigger count and branched
 *   the same way — for a run that added pages to the very bank the first step
 *   names, which is the one case where "the same reading" is not even arguable.
 *
 * The fix is not to move `pages` on its own. It is to RECORD WHAT WAS ASKED FOR:
 * `ReadRequest` carries the page skips and the language and nothing else the user
 * chose, so those are what a reading is identified by, and the count went here
 * where it always belonged. A re-read of the same request replaces; a re-read
 * asking for a different page range is a different question and branches, which
 * is the rule stated rather than approximated.
 *
 * ── AND A TRANSLATION'S BANK IS THE SAME KIND OF FACT ───────────────────────
 *
 * `translate.bank` is the file the run wrote its answers into, recorded at the
 * landing from the path the plan handed the engine. Nobody asked for it — the
 * plan composed it out of the very decision this table serves, replace or branch —
 * so comparing it would be the generation trap in another folder: a re-translation
 * planned against the same step would carry the same bank and match, but a bank
 * that ever moved (a run planned as a branch landing as a replace) would make the
 * step it was meant to swap into unrecognisable, and the user would get a second
 * English translation beside the one they asked to redo.
 *
 * WHAT IS LEFT IN THE QUESTION IS `language` AND `rewrite`, AND DELIBERATELY SO. A
 * re-translation with different instructions or a different model is the same
 * person refining THIS translation of this book, not asking a new one — they get
 * the row they already have, with better contents in it. What makes a second
 * translation into one language a second row is standing somewhere else when you
 * ask for it, which `reRunTarget` settles by the parent before it ever reaches
 * these params. (If that ruling chafes, the fix is one line in `PARAMS_OF` — which
 * is the reason the table exists.)
 *
 * `rewrite` IS THE LINE THAT RULING PREDICTED, added when a simplify became a
 * translate step carrying a mode. It is a question in the same sense the language
 * is: three cards in a dialog, one of them chosen, and the choice is what the book
 * that comes out is FOR. Two modes sharing a row would mean asking for easy
 * language destroyed the plain-terms rewrite made from the same step — the exact
 * false replace this whole table is written to prevent, in the newest folder.
 *
 * `from` IS IN THE ANSWER PILE FOR A SHARPER VERSION OF THE SAME REASON. Nobody
 * typed it: a chained run reads the source language off its parent translate step,
 * and WHICH parent is already the first thing `reRunTarget` compares. Comparing it
 * again here would mean a re-translation of a chain stopped matching the row it
 * exists to refresh the day somebody corrected the parent's own language — a
 * second English row beside the one they asked to redo.

 * Replacing means destroying, and the retention rule says user labour is never
 * destroyed by a re-run — it goes stale, visibly, and stays clickable. So an
 * irreplaceable step cannot be replaced by construction rather than by a list of

 * says they are. That falls out of the retention rule instead of restating it.
 *
 * ── And why a stale step IS a target ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Deliberately. A translation that went stale because its reading was replaced
 * is the exact thing a user re-runs, and re-running it from the same step with
 * the same language is them saying "make this one current again". Refusing would

 *
 * A REPLACE AIMS AT THE STEP'S OWN RECORDS. Same row, same path, new contents —
 * which is what `recordLanding` already says about the row, now true of the file.
 * Re-translating into a records file that is already full is what makes a
 * re-translation nearly free: every block whose masked source has not changed is
 * already answered in there and is never asked again.
 *
 * A REPLACE OF A ROW THAT PREDATES RECORDS AIMS AT THE PLAIN NAME instead, and it
 * is the one case where a re-run genuinely moves a payload. That step retains an
 * EPUB the old translator wrote (`translationRecordsOf` answers null for it); this
 * run writes records, so the row's payload changes layer, and `Landing.displaced`
 * is what destroys the book it used to name once no surviving row does. The answers
 * that book was assembled from are re-asked in full — the masked source moved a
 * stage earlier when records arrived, so every key in the old bank misses by design
 * (docs/WORKBENCH.md §10, ruling 1) — and that price was accepted when the format
 * was bumped rather than discovered here.
 *
 * A FIRST TRANSLATION INTO A LANGUAGE KEEPS THE PLAIN NAME, which is the same
 * courtesy the banks and the EPUBs were given: nothing about a project's first
 * translation into German should be spelled with a uuid in it.
 *
 * A BRANCH MINTS `<name>.<id8>.jsonl`. It deliberately does NOT share the first
 * translation's file: sharing would be harmless for cache hits and would let a
 * delete of either step destroy the answers the other one is made of, which is the
 * failure `orphanedPayloads` exists to prevent.
 *
 * ── "Plain" is asked of the ledger, by the whole path ───────────────────────

 * not consulted and do not need to be: a project holding a pre-records German

 * and every one of them owes the same four decisions: is this a re-run
 * (`reRunTarget`), what is it called (`labelFor`), what goes stale (`markStale`),
 * and what file is now nobody's. A rule re-derived at three call sites is a rule
 * that drifts, and the two ways it drifts are both expensive: a call site that
 * forgot `markStale` leaves a translation of a bank that no longer exists looking
 * current, and one that decided "replace" for itself could destroy a payload the
 * user still wanted.
 *
 * ── The replaced step KEEPS ITS PLACE AND ITS DATE ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A re-run swaps a payload; it does not move a row. Stamping the new time on it
 * would put a row claiming to have happened today above rows that happened
 * yesterday, which is precisely the file `parseLedger` refuses to load — the
 * array's order IS the chronology, and re-sorting to fix it would shuffle the
 * list under somebody who is looking at it. What changed is the payload, the
 * params the run recorded, and the label those params compose; where the step
 * sits in the story of this book did not change, because it is the same step.
 *
 * ── And nothing here touches a disk ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is only ever called on a run that SUCCEEDED, which is what makes the
 * swap-on-success rule true by construction rather than by remembering it: a
 * failed run never reaches this function, so the old payload is still on disk and
 * still the one the ledger names. `displaced` is the caller's instruction to
 * destroy something, issued after the replacement exists and never before.

 * THAT BRANCH IS NOW DELIBERATE RATHER THAN ACCIDENTAL, which is worth writing
 * down because it is what settles whether this function is still needed. It used
 * to happen when a re-read came back with a different page COUNT, which was a
 * proxy nobody chose (see `MINTED_BY_THE_RUN`); it now happens exactly when
 * somebody asks a different question of the same book. The state this defends is
 * therefore more reachable than before, not less — and a translation is the same
 * story in another folder: two `translate` steps into one language from two
 * different parents both name `generated/<book> (en).epub`, because the output
 * path is composed from the stem and the tag and knows nothing about the ledger.
 *
 * So the question is not "what did this subtree name" but "what is left naming
 * it", asked of the ledger AFTER the surgery — and asked by whole project-
 * relative path, for `namesPayload`'s reason.
 *
 * Deduplicated because the caller unlinks what this returns and a path listed
 * twice is a second unlink of something that is already gone, reported as a

 * Home's rows are drawn from — still naming the files it had just unlinked. So
 * deleting a translation gave the user a document row for an EPUB that no longer

 * keeping the husk would leave the catalogue asserting the project has an EPUB
 * with nothing behind it, and `recordStep` rebuilds the record from nothing the

 * The reading a rendering AT THE POSITION is made from — the step that owns the

 *
 * ── The lie this exists to end ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A read step's `payload` has always been the authority on where its bank lives,
 * and everything else COMPOSED that path from the project key instead of asking
 * the step: `readings/<key>.jsonl`, one per project, forever. That was true while
 * there was only ever one bank, and a re-read with different `--skip-pages`
 * branches by design (`MINTED_BY_THE_RUN`) — so a project could hold two `read`
 * steps and one file, the older of them describing a bank that had been written
 * over from under it. Standing on the older row and pressing Generate rendered
 * the newer reading, silently, with nothing on screen admitting the swap.
 *
 * So the plan asks the row. A branch mints its own bank path and the step records
 * it; every project that existed before this keeps `readings/<key>.jsonl`, which
 * is exactly what its one read step already says, so nothing on any disk moves.
 *
 * NULL FALLS BACK TO THE COMPOSED PATH, and the caller is where that happens
 * rather than here, because composing it needs the project key and this module
 * knows nothing about projects. It is the honest answer for two states: a project
 * with no reading at all, and a position standing on the import — the revert row,
 * which is about the untouched original rather than about any bank.

 * The curation snapshot a rendering AT THE POSITION is made with, or null when

 *
 * ── This is what makes the pointer worth moving ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every rendering in this app is `render(bank + overlay)`. Which overlay was
 * never a question before, because there was one: `overlays/<key>.json`, the
 * mutable working state of the block editor. A curation step freezes a copy of
 * that file, and the whole point of freezing one is to be able to stand on it and
 * get the book as it was — so the pointer has to decide which of them a Generate
 * reads, or the frozen snapshots are files nobody can ever see the effect of.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS FOUND BY WALKING UP FROM THE POSITION, and the walk stops at a
 * reading. Standing on a save gives that save; standing on the reading gives the
 * live overlay, because the reading step is where live editing happens (a curate
 * step made from that reading is a SIBLING of wherever the user is standing, not
 * an ancestor, so it is correctly not found). A chain of saves gives the newest
 * one on the path, which is the one being stood on.
 *
 * A TRANSLATE STEP FALLS THROUGH TO ITS NEAREST ANCESTOR THAT HAS ONE, and that
 * is now exactly right rather than an approximation. It used to be the whole of
 * what standing on a translation did — the rendering was the book it was
 * translated from, in the language it was translated OUT of, which is a German
 * book for somebody who clicked the row labelled *Translated (Hungarian)*. What
 * changed is not this walk: a translation bank carries no page and no order, so
 * nothing can ever render from one, and the curation that applies to the blocks
 * is still the one the translation was made under. What changed is that a
 * Generate from there no longer STOPS at the rendering — it feeds it to a
 * translate stage (`renderPipeline`, shared/pipeline.ts), and this answer is the
 * first half of that pipeline rather than a substitute for the second.
 *
 * NULL IS THE ORDINARY ANSWER. A project nobody has committed a curation in has
 * no `curate` step anywhere, so every position resolves to the live overlay and
 * nothing about this app's behaviour changes.

 * ROWS THAT DISPLAY THEMSELVES — the other half of the pointer's job, and the

 *
 * ── The ruling, in one line ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * SNAPSHOTS DISPLAY THEMSELVES AND LOCK; EVERY OTHER ROW DISPLAYS THE LIVE
 * OVERLAY AND EDITS. Standing on a `curate` puts that frozen copy on the pages
 * and takes correcting away, because the whole point of clicking an old save is
 * to see the book as it was then. Standing on anything else — the import, the
 * reading, a translation — puts the LIVE corrections on the pages and lets a
 * person work.
 *
 * ── Why a `translate` row is a live row, which is the line that changed ─────
 *
 * A translation used to be shown frozen, because the question asked of the
 * ledger was `curationInEffect` and a translation made FROM a save resolves to
 * that save. It made the editor read-only one row below the save, and it made
 * the user's own walkthrough impossible: translate from a save, and correcting
 * this book is off forever after — every row below it inherits the freeze, and
 * the only way back to a working editor is to abandon the branch you just made.
 *
 * The mistake was treating two different things as one. A TRANSLATE ROW IS A
 * STATE OF THE TEXT, NOT A SNAPSHOT OF CORRECTIONS. What it retained is a bank
 * of translated blocks; it froze nobody's strikes and there is no copy of any
 * corrections in it to be shown or protected. So the corrections pane there
 * shows the corrections that are actually being worked on — the live ones — and
 * striking a paragraph while standing on a translation is the ordinary gesture
 * the walkthrough is made of: strike, commit, and the commit is a row under the
 * translation.
 *
 * ── Why this is not `curationInEffect` with a flag ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Because it is a different question and the walk is the proof. DISPLAY IS
 * ABOUT WHICH ROW YOU CLICKED; RENDER IS ABOUT WHAT STATE IS IN EFFECT — and
 * only the second one has anything to walk. A rendering at a translation is
 * made with the curation the translation was taken under, which is a fact three
 * rows up the chain and has to be found; what the pane draws is a fact about the
 * row itself and is answered by looking at it. Folding them into one function
 * with a `forDisplay` argument would put a boolean where the difference in
 * meaning is, and the day somebody passed the wrong one the failure would be
 * silent in both directions.
 *
 * WHAT GENERATE RENDERS IS UNCHANGED BY ANY OF THIS. `renderingOverlay`
 * (electron/projects.ts) and `renderPipeline`'s `curation` (shared/pipeline.ts)
 * still ask `curationInEffect`, so a Generate is still made with the committed
 * snapshot in effect and the dialog still names it. That leaves exactly one
 * place where the pane and the Generate differ — standing on a translation with
 * strikes nobody has committed, the pages show them and a Generate of the
 * translation does not — and it is resolved the way this whole app resolves it:
 * commit, and the commit is a row (docs/TRANSLATION-STEPS.md §4).
 *
 * A TABLE, for `RETAINED_BESIDE_YOU`'s reason: the day a fifth action arrives its
 * author has to say whether that row is a frozen copy of somebody's decisions —
 * which is a question with a real answer, and one that a literal
 * `action === 'curate'` at a call site would let them skip. (A read-only LOCK
 * used to derive from this same table so the two could not drift; there is no
 * lock any more, because standing on any step is a replay of that chain and
 * there is nothing to diverge — docs/RENDERER.md §7.)

 * family — which bank, which curation, which translation — each have exactly one
 * answer because each names a whole state of something. An edit names a change,
 * and a change does not supersede the change before it: strike a running head on

 * every row on the way comes back and the REPLAY decides what the book says
 * (`replayOps`, shared/ops.ts), exactly as `metadataInEffect` hands back every
 * patch and lets the merge decide the title.
 *
 * ── AND IT IS THE ANCESTRY, WHICH IS WHERE IT PARTS COMPANY WITH METADATA ───
 *
 * A metadata row is retained beside you, so it hangs off the position as a CHILD
 * and an ancestry walk would find nothing — which is why that function asks
 * "whose parent is on the path" instead. An edit row moves the pointer onto
 * itself (`RETAINED_BESIDE_YOU`), so it is on the path by construction, and the

 * standing in, and an edit made on a branch you stepped off is not part of this
 * book any more than a translation on that branch is.
 *
 * ── BOUNDED BY THE READING, and that is the load-bearing part ───────────────
 *
 * `BOUNDS_THE_WALK`'s own rule, and an op is the sharpest case for it in the app.
 * An op names a BLOCK ID, ids are minted from a bank's answers, and the engine
 * archives a completed bank and reads every page again on a re-read — so
 * `b7-14` above a read and `b7-14` below it are two different paragraphs. Ops from
 * the far side would strike the wrong blocks with nothing on screen admitting it,
 * which is the failure `ProjectReading` exists to describe. The walk stops at the
 * read, and a chain that survived a re-read simply is not in effect.
 *
 * OLDEST FIRST, because replay is order-dependent and the order is the order they
 * were made. The chain runs origin-first, so walking it backwards and unshifting
 * puts them in the order the person did them.

 * (docs/RENDERER.md §4) — and every position under that translation reads it,
 * *"so replay is always one short hop"*. The ops above the translation are IN
 * that file. Replaying them again over it would strike rows that are already
 * gone, retype paragraphs the derived file already carries in another language,
 * and report the rest as missing: the same edits applied twice, on a document
 * that was made by applying them once.
 *
 * So the boundary is a fact about what is BAKED IN, and it belongs to the walk

 * EVERY METADATA EDIT MADE ANYWHERE ON THE WAY TO WHERE YOU ARE STANDING, in the

 *
 * ── The hole this closes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An export is cast fresh from the bank, and the bank knows nothing about the
 * title somebody typed into the dialog last week — that went into the OPF of the
 * working tree, which is not an input to a cast. So the app wrote a book, filed
 * it in `final/`, and the corrections were silently absent from it. The rows are
 * the durable record precisely so that materialisation can replay them, and this
 * is what it replays.
 *
 * ── Why this is a LIST and not the usual `nearestUpward` ────────────────────
 *
 * Every other question in this family is "which one is in effect" and has exactly
 * one answer. This one accumulates: an edit that set the title and a later one
 * that set the author are both in effect, and neither supersedes the other. So
 * every row comes back and the MERGE decides field by field — newest value wins —
 * which is `mergedMetadata` below, kept separate because merging patches is a
 * different question from finding them and only one of the two needs a ledger.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT IS NOT THE ANCESTRY, WHICH IS THE WHOLE TRAP HERE ────────────
 *
 * A metadata row is RETAINED BESIDE YOU: pressing Apply leaves the pointer where
 * it was, so the row it minted is a CHILD of the position and never one of its
 * ancestors. An ancestry walk therefore finds NOTHING in the ordinary case — edit
 * the title standing on the reading, export from the reading, and the export
 * carries nothing at all, which is the exact silence this unit exists to end,
 * reintroduced by the one function meant to end it.
 *
 * So the question is asked the way the gesture actually happened: A METADATA ROW
 * IS IN EFFECT WHEN THE STEP IT WAS MADE FROM IS ON THE PATH FROM THE IMPORT TO
 * WHERE YOU ARE. That is "everything you typed while standing anywhere you have
 * passed through", which is what a person means by "the book's title", and it
 * still refuses the things it should: an edit made while standing on the English
 * translation hangs off THAT row, so exporting the Hungarian one — a sibling,
 * made from the same reading — does not carry it. Its parent is not on the path.
 *
 * ── And why it is not bounded by the reading ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `nearestUpward` stops at a `read` because a bank's story begins there: a
 * snapshot from above it names blocks that mean something else on this side. A
 * TITLE MEANS THE SAME THING ON BOTH SIDES OF A READING. Reading the pages again
 * does not un-say what the book is called, so the path runs to the import, and a
 * correction made before the re-read is still the correction.
 *
 * IN THE ARRAY'S ORDER, which is the chronology by the ledger's own rule
 * (`parseLedger` refuses a file whose rows run backwards). That makes "newest
 * wins" a plain left-to-right fold with no comparator — and it has to be the

// corrections over the other reading's boxes, with nothing on screen admitting
// the swap — and a move onto the import, or onto any row at all while the pane
// was not in the block editor, did nothing whatsoever. Somebody with a two-step

// the whole of the complaint this exists to answer.
//
// SO THE QUESTION IS ASKED ONCE, HERE, AS ONE VALUE, and the renderer's job
// becomes "make the pane match this" rather than "work out what that click
// meant". Three surfaces were about to need the same derivation — the pane, the
// notice that admits when a move cannot be shown, and whatever phase B puts on a
// read row — and a rule re-derived at each of them is a rule that drifts, which
// is the reasoning every table in this file is built on.
//
// AND IT IS THE SEAM docs/DERIVED-BOOK.md §6 PHASE B NEEDS. A read row is going

 * this row's payload". That was never a fact about translations; it was a fact
 * about the app, which had no way to turn a step's project-relative payload into a
 * path a pane could be pointed at. Standing on a translation therefore showed the
 * pages the translation was made FROM — a German book for somebody who had just
 * clicked the row labelled *Translated (Hungarian)* — with a sentence underneath
 * admitting it. A sentence is not a document. The resolution now exists
 * (`documentAtPosition`, electron/projects.ts) and the table says the thing that
 * is actually true of a row instead.
 *
 * ── And it used to be called `SHOWS_ITS_PAYLOAD`, which stopped being true ──
 *
 * The import still shows its payload: the untouched original is a document, and
 * standing on that row means looking at it. A TRANSLATION NO LONGER DOES. What a
 * translate step retains is its records file (`translationRecordsOf`) — per-block
 * answers, in the same layer and the same shape as a reading's bank — and nobody
 * reads a `.jsonl`. What it SHOWS is the book cast from those records, which is a
 * rendering (`translationCastFile`), resolved the way every other rendering in this
 * app is: by asking the project what it holds.
 *
 * So the question the table answers is the one that did not change: IS THIS ROW A
 * BOOK OF ITS OWN, or is it another state of the project's one flowing book? Both
 * of its `true`s are books of their own — the untouched original and the
 * translation — and everything downstream wanted that question rather than the
 * payload one. `documentAtPosition` asks it to decide which document to resolve;
 * `positionPicture` asks it to decide whether the ROW belongs in the key, which is
 * what makes clicking between two translations of one book repaint; and
 * `standForDocument` asks it while walking DOWN a chain, because a descendant that
 * is a book of its own must stop the walk rather than be offered as the newest step
 * of the reading it was made from.
 *
 * A READ AND A SAVE ARE NOT. A readings bank is per-page model answers and a
 * curation snapshot is a set of decisions about blocks; what those rows show is the
 * project's flowing book, in the state that row is about.
 *
 * IT IS A FACT ABOUT THE ROW AND NOT ABOUT THE CHAIN, exactly as `DISPLAYS_ITSELF`
 * is: "what kind of thing is this row" is answered by looking at it, where "what
 * state is in effect" is answered by walking. Writing it as `action === 'translate'`
 * at the call sites that ask would make the next change a search for every place
 * that guessed.

 * three the blocks are the model's answers from THIS pass and the `(page, order)`
 * numbers an older overlay carries mean different blocks, so the id moves and the
 * archive-the-pair machinery hands that overlay off. Minting is the rule.
 *
 * THE EXCEPTION IS A FIRST READ THAT SOMEBODY WATCHED. Open the block editor

 * against the pages read so far, and a person can start correcting them; the run
 * then finishes by appending the remaining pages to the SAME bank. Nothing those
 * corrections name has moved. Minting there would archive their work aside as the
 * reward for having started early, for a run that renumbered nothing.
 *
 * So a landing adopts when all of this holds: this is the project's first read
 * step (there is no other for the id to be wrong about), the record was made by a
 * first touch and never by a landing (`readAt === 0`), and the marker it was
 * minted against is either absent — nothing had completed, so the run in progress
 * is the one that made those pages — or is the very marker this landing sees,
 * meaning the bank finished before and has not been read since.

 * read from a terminal, corrected in the app, then read again from the OCR dialog
 * lands as this project's first read step with `readAt === 0` — every condition

 *
 * ── What can honestly be reconstructed, and what cannot ─────────────────────
 *
 * Modelled on `migrateToSteps` in shared/steps.ts, including its rule: a
 * migration says what the catalogue said and never invents what it did not. The
 * old catalogue recorded an import, the fact and size of a completed reading, and
 * a chain of files per type. It did not record which reading a translation was
 * made from, or what language it was into — that survives only inside a filename,
 * and reading a fact out of a filename is the basename matching this codebase
 * has already paid for twice.
 *
 * So three things come out, and nothing else:
 *
 *   THE ORIGIN, from `archive`, or from the first chain's origin for a project
 *   adopted out of the old flat workspace, which has outputs and no import.
 *
 *   THE READING, when there is evidence of one. `manifest.reading` is the direct
 *   evidence; a v1 catalogue predates that field entirely, and its evidence is
 *   that the engine MADE something — every `expensive` step in a chain was cast,
 *   reprinted, written out or translated from a bank, and none of those can
 *   exist without one. A project imported and never converted gets no reading
 *   step, and neither does one started from an EPUB, which has no pages to read.
 *
 *   THE TRANSLATIONS, one per `translate` step in the chains, oldest first,
 *   parented to the reading where there is one. Their payload is the EPUB that
 *   was retained, because that IS what was retained — the per-block translation
 *   bank is a later invention and no old project has one.
 *
 * Renderings do NOT become steps, which is the substantive judgement here rather
 * than a detail of shape. A cast EPUB, a reprinted PDF and a text file are three
 * renderings of one bank, free to make again; minting a step for each would put
 * three filenames where one action belongs and would offer the user a delete
 * button for something that costs nothing.
 *
 * ── Determinism, and why it is a requirement rather than a nicety ───────────
 *
 * READING A MANIFEST TWICE MUST PRODUCE THE SAME LEDGER, byte for byte. This
 * runs on every read of an un-migrated project — `readManifest` migrates in
 * memory and writes back only when something else edits the file — so a ledger
 * built from a uuid generator or from `Date.now()` would give a project a
 * different history on every open, and the ids in it are what the pointer, the
 * parent chain and the queue's captured parent all point at. A pointer written
 * on Tuesday would name a step that no longer exists on Wednesday.
 *
 * So the ids are ordinal — `m0`, `m1`, … in the order the steps are built — and
 * derived from nothing but the manifest's own contents and order. A hash of the
 * payload path was the obvious alternative and is worse: two chain rows are
 * allowed to name one file, and two steps with one id is a ledger that refuses
 * itself. The `m` says out loud that these were reconstructed rather than
 * recorded.
 *
 * The times come from the catalogue too — `createdAt` for the import, `readAt`
 * for the reading, `appliedAt` for a translation — clamped so the list never
 * runs backwards, because a v1 catalogue's `madeAt` values were written by
 * whatever the clock said at the time and one of them being earlier than the
 * import is a thing that happens.
