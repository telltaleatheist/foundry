/**
 * shared/book — the BOOK FILE, read back into the shapes the app draws.
 *
 * ── This is a MIRROR of src/vlm/book-file.ts, and the two must grow together ──
 *
 * The engine owns the format. `vlm-book` reflows a readings bank into one row
 * per block — hyphens fused, page turns joined, ids minted, notes cut apart —
 * and writes `readings/<key>.book.jsonl`; `src/vlm/book-file.ts` is where that
 * grammar is decided and `docs/BOOK-FILE.md` is the contract both files answer
 * to. This file states the same grammar a second time, in the app, and nothing
 * here is allowed to be an opinion about it.
 *
 * IT IS RESTATED FOR `shared/unrender.ts`'s REASON, which is the precedent this
 * follows entry for entry. The app never imports a line of the engine — it
 * spawns it (electron/engine.ts) — and spawning a process to parse a file this
 * process is already holding open would be absurd. So the table is written twice
 * with the engine's file named as the contract, and the refusals below are what
 * make forgetting the second copy LOUD rather than silent: a row missing a field
 * takes the whole file down by name, and a header declaring a version this
 * program does not write is refused before a single row is read.
 *
 * If the engine's format grows a field, BOTH files grow. The version number is
 * the thing that makes that non-optional: a v4 book meets a sentence here rather
 * than a renderer quietly drawing a book with its new half missing.
 *
 * ── WHY A BAD ROW TAKES THE FILE DOWN ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The engine's parser says it and it is worth saying again on this side, because
 * this side is the one with a person looking at it: this document is what every
 * op in the project is keyed to. A book assembled out of the rows that happened
 * to parse is a book with paragraphs silently missing — and the person editing it
 * would be striking, splitting and re-ordering blocks in a document that is not
 * the one on disk. A sentence naming the block that is wrong costs a reload; a
 * lenient parse costs somebody's afternoon and says nothing at all.
 *
 * ── What v3 added over v2, in one paragraph ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PROVENANCE, PARTS, SEAMS, THE SHELF AND THE FIGURES. The header now says what
 * the book is made of — the engine that wrote it, the read's declared language,
 * and `source.bankSha`, the identity of the receipt underneath, which is what
 * lets a loader refuse a book whose bank has moved from under its ids. Every row
 * carries `parts` in place of v2's bare `src` list: which banked answer
 * contributed which characters of its finished text, char-exact, so the page
 * inside a joined paragraph is a fact and not arithmetic. The page turns the
 * reflow declined are pairs of BLOCK IDS (`seams`), because a person joining one
 * is joining two paragraphs and "p13" names neither. The page furniture and the
 * suppressed running heads are ROWS now, at their reading-order positions,
 * wearing `shelf` and a sentence of `why` — nothing the model answered is
 * silently gone. And a Picture row can carry `image`: the name of its crop in
 * `readings/<key>.images/`, cut once when the book was made.

/**
 * A book file, written down — a header line, then one row per block.
 *
 * ── WHY THE APP WRITES ONE AT ALL ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The engine is the writer of this format and stays the writer of it: `vlm-book`
 * makes a book out of a bank and nothing here will ever do that. What this writes
 * is the DERIVED book file — the same format with the same ids, with a chain of
 * ops replayed into it (docs/RENDERER.md §4) — and it has to be written here for
 * the reason the replay lives in shared/ at all: there is one implementation of
 * "what does this book say now", it is `replayOps`, and it runs in this process.
 * An engine that could materialise would be a second one (§9, R1).
 *
 * THE HEADER'S FIELDS ARE THE CONTRACT'S, IN THE CONTRACT'S ORDER, and the row
 * lines are the rows as this module parses them — same field order, same
 * spelling — so that a file written here is a file the engine's own parser reads
 * without a special case (`parseBookFile`, src/vlm/book-file.ts). Anything else
 * would be two dialects of one format, and the second one would be discovered by
 * an export failing.
 *
 * NO TIMESTAMP AND NOTHING ABOUT THIS MACHINE, which is what makes the same book
 * and the same chain produce the same bytes anywhere.
