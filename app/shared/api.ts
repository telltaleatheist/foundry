   * REGISTERED ONCE AND NOT UNREGISTERED. The card is mounted for the whole life
   * of the window (see `ConfirmDialogComponent`), so there is no moment where it
   * is right for a question to go somewhere else.
   *
   * WITH NOTHING REGISTERED, A QUESTION IS NOT ASKED AND THEREFORE NOT AGREED TO.
   * Every one of the five resolves with its own safe answer — keep the tab, undo
   * the edit, leave the reading alone — because a renderer that cannot draw a
   * card cannot have been answered, and the alternative is spending hours of GPU

     * the workshop — so it asks none of that, and a caller that had to remember to
     * pass the right flag to skip a refusal is a caller that will one day pass the
     * wrong one.

     * EVERYTHING ELSE IS IDENTICAL, deliberately: the same completed-bank refusal
     * said in the same words, the same curation resolved from the same position,

     * stands under one — so exporting the Hungarian from a save made under it
     * produces the Hungarian with that save's cuts applied, which is the whole
     * promise of making a product from a row. The answer is a `WorkspacePlan` like
     * any other; only `outputPath` says where it landed.
     *
     * The caller sets `GenerateRequest.export` on the request it builds from this.
     * That flag is what the queue's landing reads, and it is the renderer's to set

   * ── And why the ordering never crosses the boundary ───────────────────────
   *
   * EVERY ONE OF THESE ANSWERS WITH THE ROWS ALREADY COMPOSED. The chronological
   * order and the "from …" annotation are the whole of this design's concession to
   * the tree, and a renderer deriving them would be a second implementation of the
   * one rule that decides whether the flat list is misleading about what was made
   * from what. Three of these used to hand back a bare ledger, which left the

   * THE BOOK — the one document this app edits, as the renderer draws it.
   *
   * ── Why a project directory and not a file ────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Because the renderer has no business knowing which file the book is in.
   * Which bank a position's reading left, where the reflow of that bank lives,
   * and whether it has been made yet are all main's records — the same records
   * `ledger.documentAt` reads one door up, resolved in the same place so the two
   * cannot come to disagree. A renderer that composed the path would be a second
   * opinion about which of two readings a branch is about, which is the failure
   * `readingBank` (electron/projects.ts) exists to end.
   *
   * ── It can be slow exactly once, and the sheet says so ────────────────────
   *
   * A project whose bank has never been reflowed has its book file MADE on this
   * call — main spawns the engine and waits — which doubles as the migration for
   * every project in the library, since they all predate the format
   * (docs/RENDERER.md §9, R2). It is seconds of arithmetic over a file that is
   * already on disk, it happens once per reading, and the pane shows
   * `Opening the book…` while it runs.
   *
   * IT ANSWERS WITH A SENTENCE RATHER THAN REJECTING, on this app’s own rule
   * and for its reason: a book that has not been read yet, a bank the engine
   * would not reflow and a file whose grammar this build does not know are all
   * states a person should meet as words on the paper (RENDERER-DESIGN.md §5)
   * rather than as a broken tab. The sentences carry no paths, and the pane
   * renders whichever one comes back verbatim — the alternative to a sentence is
   * an empty sheet that looks exactly like a book with nothing in it.
   *
   * IT DOES REJECT for a directory that is not one of Home's projects, which is
   * the security gate refusing rather than the book being unavailable.

   *
   * ── The doors, and why the renderer needs each of them ─────────────────────
   *
   * `offers` IS THE FIRST PAINT AND `onOffersChanged` IS EVERY REVISION AFTER
   * IT. It was asked ONCE, like `hosted()`, on the reasoning that a host
   * registers its operations at mount and nothing can change them while the
   * process lives — and that conflated a fact ASKED once with a fact that CANNOT
   * change. A host whose own form legitimately moves while the window is up (a
   * voice installed since, a setting changed since, an act it can no longer
   * honour) had no way to publish it, and a subscription that never fires for
   * every host that never revises costs nothing. `nodes` is the first paint — a window
   * that opened after the host had already pushed has to be able to catch up —
   * and `onChanged` is every push after that, carrying the whole set for one
   * project on `queue.onChanged`'s precedent.
   *
   * `invoke` NAMES AN OPERATION BY ID AND A NODE BY ID, and that pair is the
   * entire request: main turns the operation id back into the host's own function
   * (a renderer can only name something the host registered), and the node id is
   * what the user pressed "from here" on — a ledger step when the act was ordered
   * from something this app made, one of the host's own nodes when it was chained
   * onto work that has not finished yet.
   *
   * `status` IS THE ONE THAT IS NOT ABOUT A BOOK. The three above describe work
   * ordered from a row and land on that row; the status describes the host's own
   * queue and lands in the window's top corner, once, whichever book is open.
   * Same three shapes as everything else here — a read for the first paint, a
   * push for every change, an invoke for the click — so nothing about it is a
   * new kind of thing to learn.
   *
   * STANDALONE IT IS TWO EMPTY LISTS, A NULL AND A DOOR NOBODY OPENS, which is
