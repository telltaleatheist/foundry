/**
 * What a row in the shelf IS.
 *
 * `epub` is the only thing the engine casts. `env-install` is not a conversion
 * at all — it is the app fetching a prebuilt Python — but it shares the queue on
 * purpose: it is long, it is cancellable, and a conversion that needs the
 * environment must wait BEHIND it rather than race it. One serial queue gave
 * that for free; a board of lanes has to say it, and does (an install is
 * `exclusive`, shared/queue-board.ts).
 *
 * `translate` is a conversion whose INPUT is an EPUB and whose output is
 * another one. It is not in `ConversionKind` and that is deliberate: a
 * conversion kind doubles as the output's file extension (see below), and a
 * file called `book.translate` is not a thing. Its output is named by
 * `planTranslation` instead, which knows the language tag belongs in the
 * middle. It shares the GPU lane with a reading for the reason that lane holds
 * one job — it keeps a model resident for hours, and two at once is two runs
 * that each take twice as long.
 *
 * WHICH RESOURCE EACH OF THESE NEEDS IS DECLARED ONCE, in shared/queue-board.ts,
 * and both the scheduler and the shelf read it there. A kind added here without
 * a row there fails the typecheck, which is the whole reason that table is a
 * `Record` over this union.
 */
/**
 * The things the queue can be holding.
 *
 * `read` IS THE ONE THAT COSTS ANYTHING, and separating it out is the change the
 * whole front door turned on. A conversion used to be one act: read three
 * hundred pages with a vision model AND write an EPUB, chosen together in one
 * dialog, so asking for the same book as plain text afterwards meant either
 * re-reading it or knowing that `--reuse-readings` existed.
 *
 * They are two acts and they have nothing in common. READING is hours of GPU
 * against pages nobody has seen, it is resumable, it is batched, and its product
 * is the BANK. GENERATING is arithmetic over answers that are already on the
 * disk — seconds, offline, free, and repeatable as often as somebody likes. The
 * queue holds both because both spawn the engine; everything else about them
 * differs, starting with the fact that one waits for a person to press Start and
 * the other must never.
 *
 * `mint` IS THE SECOND MEMBER THAT SPAWNS NOTHING, after `env-install`, and the
 * sentence above about the engine is the reason it needs saying here. A mint is
 * the capture stage assembling a PDF out of photographs (docs/CAPTURE.md): the
 * pixels are rectified in the RENDERER, one page at a time, so the row exists to
 * be seen and cancelled rather than to be run. It must never occupy a slot on
 * the board — an interactive mint sitting in one would hold a reading behind it
 * for minutes — and `env-install` is the precedent for a row the pump hands to
 * something other than `executeJob`.

 * drifting apart would mean the app naming a file `.epub` and the engine
 * writing text into it — which the engine refuses outright (src/vlm/text-out.ts).
 *
 * `pdf` IS a third way of writing the book, and it used not to be. It once
 * produced the source document with an invisible layer over its pages — the
 * scan, made searchable. It now reprints the book as real, visible type on fresh
 * pages the shape of the scan's, at the positions the model measured, and throws

   * per-step cast is a RENDERING of a payload that is already a step: free, made
   * again from that step's snapshot or records at any time, and deliberately NOT
   * catalogued as a document. Two things depend on that. `castBook`

   * listing the documents a person made rather than growing one per Apply.

   * A TRANSLATION'S BOOK IS UNCATALOGUED FOR THE SAME REASON AND AT A PRICE WORTH
   * NAMING: Home's per-type EPUB list no longer holds a row for a translated book,
   * where the old EPUB→EPUB translator's output was filed there as one. The tree
   * draws from the ledger (docs/WORKBENCH.md §6c) and the translate step is in it,

 * AN EXPORT, THE MOMENT IT LANDS — the one thing Foundry says out loud to

 *
 * ── Why this crosses a boundary that nothing else does ──────────────────────
 *
 * Hosted, Foundry's window is where a book is made and BookForge's versions page
 * is where finished things are listed (docs/BOOKFORGE-HANDOFF.md §8). Those are
 * two truths about one moment: the file goes into `<project>/final/` and stays
 * there — nothing is copied, nothing is moved — and the host learns that a row
 * pointing AT IT is now worth drawing.
 *
 * ── "NO BYTES, NO STEP, NO LEDGER" — AND THE STEP CAME BACK ─────────────────
 *
 * This paragraph used to end: *a path and enough words to name a row with, and
 * nothing else: no bytes, no step, no ledger. A host that wants more asks the
 * project folder, which is the whole truth and always was.* Two thirds of that
 * still stand. The STEP does not, and it was Owen's first real use of the loop
 * that settled it (BookForge → Foundry, 2026-08-18):
 *
 *   *"`ExportLanding = {projectDir, path, kind, title}` carries no step id, so
 *   the host cannot know WHICH step an export was cast from. Today
 *   narrate-from-any-node resolves to 'the project's one exported EPUB' and
 *   refuses when there are two. Owen's expectation is stronger: narrate on a
 *   step should mean 'the export made from this step's state'."*
 *
 * The old reasoning was not wrong about hosts and folders; it was wrong about
 * WHICH TRUTH THE FOLDER HOLDS. A project directory tells you every export that
 * exists, and it cannot tell you which of them a given row of the tree produced
 * — that fact exists for one instant, inside the queue, in the step the job
 * captured when the button was pressed, and it is gone the moment the job
 * settles. So "ask the project folder" was an answer to a question the folder
 * could not answer, and a host obeying it had to fall back to guessing whenever
 * a book had been exported twice.
 *
 * IT IS THE ONE FIELD THAT COULD NOT BE RECOVERED LATER, which is what makes it
 * belong on the announcement rather than behind a door. No bytes and no ledger
 * still hold: a host wanting the words opens the file, and a host wanting the
 * history reads `project.json`. This is neither — it is the provenance OF THIS
 * LANDING, known here and nowhere else.
 *
 * IT LIVES IN `shared/` RATHER THAN IN THE MOUNT SEAM because it is the shape of
 * an announcement, and announcements in this app are declared where both ends
 * can compile against them — the same rule that put every IPC payload here.

 * enhanced narration, an assembled audiobook. Every operation declares which of
 * these it consumes (`HostOperationOffer.appliesTo`) and every node is one of
 * these, so "what may be done from here" is a single comparison and never a list
 * of special cases — a Translate is not offered on a narration, and an Assemble
 * is not offered on a book, by the same one rule in both directions.
 *
 * ── `export` IS THE THIRD, AND IT IS OWEN'S RULING MADE EXPRESSIBLE ─────────
 *
 * *"just put 'export EPUB' as the only option on things that aren't capable of
 * narration or whatever. The only options that exist are the ones that are
 * possible for that stage."* (2026-08-17 20:30, via the bridge.) What he had hit
 * was Narrate offered on "Applied changes" — a ledger step, which produces the
 * WORDS — while narration reads a finished FILE, so on a project with nothing
 * exported the press could only ever refuse.
 *
 * The two currencies could not tell those apart. A ledger step and an export row
 * both produced `book`, so one comparison put an `appliesTo: 'book'` operation on
 * both, and there was no spelling for "this act consumes the exported file and
 * only that". `export` is that spelling: EXPORT ROWS PRODUCE IT AND LEDGER STEPS
 * NEVER DO, so an operation declaring it lands on `final/` rows alone.

 *
 * A TWO-MEMBER HOST KEEPS WORKING UNCHANGED. `offeredFrom` is still one
 * comparison, so an operation still saying `appliesTo: 'book'` still lands on
 * every book-producing step exactly as it did — which is the state BookForge's
 * current vendored injection is in, and it must not break in the interim before
 * their next re-vendor moves narrate onto the new member. Growing a union is

 * nothing that was offered before is offered differently now, and one thing that
 * was offered in two places can now be asked for in one.
 *
 * A CLOSED SET AND NOT AN OPEN STRING, because the tree has to be able to gate on
 * it. A host inventing a fourth currency would be a host asking Foundry to draw

 * The identity of a READING — the model's pass over the pages — so that a file of

 *
 * ── The hazard, which is why this exists at all ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * An overlay names blocks as `(page, order, part)`: the page, the element's place
 * in the model's answer for that page, and the piece of it a split cut out. Those
 * numbers are stable across every RE-RENDER of a bank, which is the whole reason
 * the scheme works — the answers are replayed verbatim and the split is
 * deterministic over them. They are not stable across a RE-READ. The engine
 * archives a completed bank and reads every page again, the model answers
 * differently, and `{"page": 7, "order": 14}` afterwards is whatever the new pass
 * happened to answer fourteenth. Amendments from the previous life would then
 * strike a different block and split the book in a different place, with nothing
 * on screen saying anything had happened. That is the failure this app spends its
 * refusals avoiding, and it is exactly the one `ProjectWorkingTree.generation`
 * guards for a book's undo history.
 *
 * ── Why a READING mints one and a rendering does not ────────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious design mints a uuid when any conversion finishes. It is wrong in
 * one ordinary case and the case is common: converting a book to plain text
 * after curating its EPUB runs the engine again, records another step, and
 * replays the SAME bank — every block identical, every amendment still exactly
 * about the block it was made about. A generation minted per job would throw
 * that curation aside and tell the user their corrections had been archived, for
 * a run that changed nothing.
 *
 * So a generation is minted by a READING LANDING and by nothing else, which is
 * exactly the event that renumbers the blocks. The authority is the read step's
 * own `params.generation` (`LedgerParams.generation`) and the one a viewer
 * compares against is the POSITION'S — the nearest read step on the ancestry, so
 * two branches of a book compare their overlays against their own pass over the
 * pages. `readingGeneration` (electron/projects.ts) is where that is asked; this
 * record is what answers for a project whose ledger holds no read step at all.
 *
 * ── It used to count archive folders, and both legs were knocked out ────────
 *
 * `passes` was how many banks the `readings/archived-<stamp>/` folders held when
 * the generation was minted, on the reading that the engine archived a completed
 * bank before reading it again — so a re-read incremented the count and a
 * re-render did not. That was always a proxy, and two changes landed together
 * that made it a false one: a re-read now writes a PENDING bank and swaps it in
 * on success (docs/BANK-LIFECYCLE.md §2), so nothing archives and the count
 * never moves; and a re-read asking for a different page range BRANCHES to a

   * WHAT IT WOULD COST TO GET THIS BACK — the field the whole store turns on.

   * THREE STATES AND NOT A BOOLEAN, and the third one was learned the hard way.
   * A first version of this asked only "is it expensive?", with cheap meaning
   * "regenerate rather than store". That rule is right about machine work and
   * DANGEROUSLY WRONG about a person's: a hundred keystrokes are trivial for a
   * computer to write out again and impossible for anybody to reproduce. A
   * two-state field could not tell those apart, and the first thing it would
   * have got wrong is the one thing in a project that is genuinely unrecoverable.
   *
   * So the question is not "was this expensive" but "what happens if it is
   * gone", and there are three answers:
   *
   *   `irreplaceable` — NOTHING gets it back. The file the user imported, whose
   *   provenance only they know; and anything a PERSON made, at any size. Never
   *   swept, never regenerated, and named first in any warning about erasing it.
   *
   *   `expensive` — a machine can make it again, at a cost somebody would feel.
   *   Hours of GPU: a vision model over three hundred pages, a translation of
   *   every block. Kept because redoing it is a real price, not because it
   *   cannot be redone.
   *
   *   `regenerable` — cheap, deterministic, and derivable from what is still
   *   here. Zipping a tree, unpacking one, rendering a deliverable at export.
   *   These are MATERIALISED WHEN ASKED FOR rather than stored, which is the
   *   whole reason the folder does not fill with copies nobody can account for.
   *
   * ── What the store is actually for ──────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Not "a copy of every file we ever wrote". The user's words: "this is about
   * retaining data from steps that took a lot of resources to run or acquire…
   * being able to step back if they make a mistake, or to keep different
   * steps/changes easily." So the store keeps the top two and lets the third go,
   * and the two operations it is designed for are STEPPING BACK and HOLDING
   * VARIANTS — not delivering files. A deliverable is a rendering of retained
   * data and is made at export.
   *
   * The READINGS BANK is this exact principle one layer down: the bank is the
   * `expensive` thing, the reprint is a `regenerable` rendering of it, and that
   * is precisely why a rerun is free.
   *
   * ── Why it is DATA and not a rule in the code ───────────────────────────
   *
   * Four passes ask this question — the asset sweep, the rotation, the delete
   * warning and the step chain — and a rule re-derived at each of them from the
   * role, the directory or the file extension is a rule that drifts. Asked of
   * the step, there is one answer, written down by the code that knew.

 * ── What this replaced, and what the OS chrome was costing ──────────────────
 *
 * Five questions in this program went out as `dialog.showMessageBox`: the
 * closing document, the unlinked footnote, the re-read, and the two echoes
 * between a page heading and its contents entry. A native box is genuinely
 * modal to the WINDOW, which is the one thing it did better than anything in
 * here — and it is the OS's rectangle, in the OS's fonts, with the OS's button
 * order and the OS's idea of which button is dangerous. A program whose every
 * other question is a card in its own idiom, asking these five through a system
 * alert, reads as a program interrupted by something else; the user's ruling was
 * "we should have zero js alerts. they should all be custom modals."
 *
 * ── The split that did NOT move ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The sentences stay MAIN'S. `aboutTheCorrections` knows what a save is worth
 * and `aboutTheCopy` knows where a copy is not; the renderer knows neither and
 * must never start writing its own copy, which is how a warning worth reading
 * becomes "Are you sure?". So what crosses the seam is the composed question,
 * and what comes back is the answer's own WORD (`QuestionChoice.key`) rather
 * than a button index. An index means different things in boxes of different
 * shapes — `response === 0` was "close it" in one of these and "save first" in
 * the other — and the way that goes wrong is silent. The key is the answer
 * union's own member, so main's composition and the caller's `switch` are held
 * together by the compiler instead of by a lookup table.
 *

   * A facsimile is TERMINAL in exactly the sense an export is: nothing is made

   * (docs/RENDERER.md §0 A3). So it wants the row an export gets — a leaf under

   * the PDF's chain beside the scan and make Home offer it as the document this
   * app edits. `exports` is `final/`, which is the user's own
   * tray — a file this app made unasked has no business in it.
   *
   * COMPOSED, NOT CATALOGUED, and the argument is its own: the name comes off the read step's own id, so the landing writes
   * nothing, `project.json` grows no row, and the same three parties — the plan
   * that writes the file, this listing, and the sweep that removes it with its
   * step — cannot come to three answers. What is on disk is the authority on
   * whether the row exists at all, which is why main stats each one and drops
   * the rows it cannot find: a nav row that opens nothing is worse than no row,
   * and every project reads before this existed has a reading and no facsimile.
   *
   * `madeAt` is the READ STEP's own moment rather than the file's mtime. The
   * facsimile is that reading's product and is remade whenever the reading is,
   * so the date a person is owed is the day the pages were read — and a stat for

 * exists anywhere you chose", the Chrome dot. It was true FROM BIRTH for every
 * book this app opens out of a project, so closing a tab somebody had merely
 * looked at raised a warning about a loss that had not happened: the book is in
 * its project, Home still lists it, the working copy holds every edit, and
 * closing the tab loses track of nothing. The user ruled it out in one sentence
 * — *"only pop up a confirmation alert if changes have been made"* — and the
 * ruling was already implied by the surface around it: saving is the export
 * modal's job now (docs/WORKBENCH.md §6), so "you have not filed a copy of this"
 * is a warning about a workflow this app no longer has.
 *
 * The dot itself STAYS. `Tab.unsaved` is a statement about where a document
 * lives and it is worth drawing; what it is not is a reason to interrupt
 * somebody on their way out of a tab.
 *
 * So what is left is two things worth a sentence. `modified` is "you have edited

 *
 * IT IS THE CLOSING QUESTION'S TWIN AND SHARES ITS ARITHMETIC. `edits` is

 * outside the card answer, which is the app's own `dismissed` machinery
 * (`AppQuestion.dismissed`) rather than a third choice competing with the two

 *
 * `without` IS RETIRED AND THIS IS ITS GRAVESTONE. It meant *"continue without
 * them"* — leave the stack on the page and make the older book anyway — and the
 * argument for it was real: making the recorded book from a position you are
 * standing on is a thing somebody can genuinely mean. It went because the

/**
 * The five things that mint a step. Everything else a project does is free.
 *
 * IT IS A SHORT LIST BECAUSE A STEP IS A RETAINED PAYLOAD, not an event. The
 * queue is where expense happens, a step is what one expensive job left behind,
 * and everything else — rendering an EPUB, a PDF, a text file; moving the
 * pointer; opening a tab — is a rendering of a payload that already exists and
 * costs nothing to make again.
 *
 * `curate` IS THE ODD ONE OUT AND EARNS ITS PLACE ANYWAY. It spends no GPU and
 * needs no queue job — it is the user pressing Save in the block editor, which
 * freezes the live overlay as a snapshot. It is here because the retention rule
 * is about what it costs to GET SOMETHING BACK, not what it cost to make, and a
 * person's judgement about four hundred blocks is the one thing in a project
 * that nothing can reproduce.
 *
 * ── AND `metadata` IS THE SECOND ONE OF THOSE, FOR THE SAME REASON ──────────
 *
 * The user's own ruling put it here — "only steps that are going to lead to
 * another step or to export are added to the steps ledger. including edit
 * metadata" (docs/WORKBENCH.md §1) — and the ledger was lying by omission until
 * it was: the dialog wrote a title straight into the open document's package and
 * NOTHING else learned it had happened. No row, no announce, and, worse, an
 * EXPORT that quietly lost the edit, because an export is cast fresh from the
 * bank and the working tree's package is not one of its inputs. Both of those
 * stop being true the moment the edit is a step: the row is the durable record,
 * and materialisation applies the chain of them to whatever it makes.
 *
 * IRREPLACEABLE, on the same clause of the retention rule `curate` sits on. A
 * title, an author, a publisher and a date are typed by a person out of the
 * book in their hands — no machine makes them again at any price, and the fact
 * that the write itself costs milliseconds is exactly the thing that rule was
 * written to stop mattering.
 *
 * AND THE POINTER DOES NOT MOVE FOR IT (`RETAINED_BESIDE_YOU`). A metadata edit
 * does not make a new state of the book to go and stand in; it records something
 * about the state you are already standing in, and a pointer that jumped would
 * take the block editor read-only as the reward for correcting an author's name.
 * Each Apply appends its own row — two corrections are two decisions, and the
 * newest value of a field is what the exports carry.
 *
 * NO `generate`, deliberately. A rendering is reproducible from its step's
 * payload at any time, and minting a step for one would put a filename where an
 * action belongs. If "what did I export and when" is ever wanted, it is an
 * export log — a separate thing, and not this.
 */
/*
 * `edit` IS THE BOOK'S OWN ACTION, and it is the one this whole renderer plan is
 * built around. What it retains is a JSONL file of OPS — one line per decision,
 * keyed by block id (`shared/ops.ts`, docs/RENDERER.md §3) — written whole when
 * somebody presses Apply and never appended to afterwards. It is a DELTA: what
 * the book says at any position is the reflowed book file with the ops of every
 * edit step on the path replayed over it, in order.
 *
 * IRREPLACEABLE, on the clause of the retention rule `curate` and `metadata` sit
 * on. A strike, a retyped sentence and a relabelled heading are somebody's
 * judgement about their book; no run remakes them at any price, and the fact that
 * writing the file costs milliseconds is exactly what that rule exists to stop
 * mattering.
 *
 * AND THE POINTER MOVES ONTO IT, which is where it parts company with a save.
 * A curate step is retained BESIDE you because the live overlay already carries
 * the decisions and standing on the snapshot would only take the editor
 * read-only. An edit step is the opposite: its ops reach the page ONLY through
 * the chain from the position, so a pointer left behind would mean pressing
 * Apply and watching every change vanish off the paper. See `RETAINED_BESIDE_YOU`

 * written itself. The type said yes and the file said no.

/**
 * ── THE CAPTURE STAGE'S RECIPE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * docs/CAPTURE.md is the plan of record and this is its schema in TypeScript.
 * A project that arrived as PHOTOGRAPHS keeps its originals untouched and
 * content-addressed, and everything a person does to them lives here: the split
 * line, the four-corner quads, the strikes and the order. Nothing edits an
 * original, so every page in a minted PDF is derivable from originals + recipe.
 *
 * ── PLAIN CURRENT STATE, NOT AN OPS JOURNAL, and the divergence is deliberate ─
 *
 * The derived book replays ops because strikes must survive a regenerated bank.
 * Here nothing upstream ever regenerates — the originals are immutable bytes —
 * so there is nothing to replay onto and a journal would be machinery with no
 * customer. Same non-destructive guarantee, simpler mechanism. The renderer
 * reads and writes the whole document; it is kilobytes for hundreds of photos.
 *
 * ── ONE UNIT FOR THE WHOLE FILE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * EVERY COORDINATE HERE IS A FRACTION OF THE WORKING COPY, 0..1 — quads and
 * `split.x` alike. It is written as one rule because the alternative was two:
 * the schema once pinned quads in absolute pixels while `split.x` was already a
 * fraction, and the first real shoot proved why that could not stand. Twenty-six
 * of its twenty-seven photos are 4032x3024 and one is 5712x4284, so an absolute
 * quad copied onto the odd one landed outside the image.
 *
 * NORMALIZING DOES NOT MAKE COPYING SAFE, AND NOTHING ABOUT THE UNIT COULD.
 * After the decoder's upright rotation those same twenty-six photos are PORTRAIT
 * and the odd one stays LANDSCAPE, and a normalized quad copied across that
 * boundary is a silent STRETCH — in bounds, plausible, wrong, and invisible all
 * the way into the PDF. The precondition is SAME SHAPE, which is why apply-to-all
 * and late-drop inheritance skip any photo whose aspect differs by more than 2%
 * and say which ones they skipped. See docs/CAPTURE.md, "The recipe, exactly".

 * THE GUTTER, AS TWO ENDPOINTS RIDING OPPOSITE EDGES OF THE PAGE THEY CUT.
 *
 * ── Why a segment, when one number said it for a whole wave ────────────────
 *
 * This was `{ x }`: one fraction along the quad, which can only ever draw a
 * cut PARALLEL TO THE SIDES. A book laid open under a phone is never quite
 * square to it, so the gutter leans a degree or two — and a straight cut
 * through a leaning gutter takes a sliver of the facing page onto both
 * leaves, at the binding, where the words are tightest. Two endpoints, each
 * dragged along an edge, draw the lean as ONE gesture. A spread photographed
 * on its side is the same gesture on the other pair of edges.
 *
 * ── OPPOSITE EDGES IS THE CONSTRAINT EVERYTHING ELSE RESTS ON ─────────────
 *
 * A segment between opposite edges cuts a quadrilateral into two
 * quadrilaterals. A segment between ADJACENT edges cuts a corner off: a
 * triangle and a pentagon, and the mint can print neither — it rectifies FOUR
 * corners onto a rectangle and has no other shape. So the constraint is what
 * keeps "both halves are printable pages" true, and `halvesOf` REFUSES a
 * segment that does not resolve to an opposite pair rather than approximating
 * one.
 *
 * ── Fractions of the working copy, WHICH `{x}` DELIBERATELY WAS NOT ───────
 *
 * `x` was measured ALONG THE QUAD, so the gutter stayed on the gutter while
 * somebody dragged the crop in around it. These are points on the PHOTOGRAPH,
 * like every other coordinate in this file — so a corner dragged after a split
 * leaves the endpoints exactly where they were, no longer on any edge.
 *
 * That is tolerable for one reason, and it is worth naming rather than
 * discovering: THE QUADS ARE AUTHORITATIVE and this is only the handle’s own
 * memory of where it was let go. `halvesOf` re-seats each endpoint on the edge
 * nearest it before cutting, so a segment left behind by a re-crop is
 * corrected rather than trusted.

   * a person saying they are done with that verb, and THE DERIVATION NEVER

   * yes.

   * WHICH PASS THIS PROJECT IS IN — crop everything, then split everything.
   *
   * ── Why the order is worth storing at all ────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Owen: *"maybe my goal should be to crop the pages so theyre positioned
   * right, then it moves to the page splitting after cropping is done. if
   * cropping is done, page splits will almost certainly be lined up already."*
   * That is the whole argument. Once the crops are applied every page is a
   * squared, registered rectangle, so the gutter sits in nearly the same
   * fractional place on all of them and ONE cut placed once fits the book. The
   * pass is what makes that true by construction rather than by luck.
   *
   * It is also what lets each surface offer one kind of handle: corners in the
   * crop pass, the line in the split pass. What is grabbable answers the
   * question "am I changing this page or the book" before it is asked.
   *
   * ── ABSENT IS THE CROP PASS, and there is no `'crop'` to write ───────────
   *
   * Every recipe ever written is in the crop pass, which is where a project
   * starts and where *Reopen crops* returns it. Storing the beginning would be
   * storing a default, and the file stays silent about what nobody chose — the
   * same rule `prepared` follows for its unticked verbs.
   *
   * ── IT IS A COMMITMENT POINT, NOT A SECOND RENDER ────────────────────────
   *
   * Apply moves the pass and lands the book's crop on the followers; from there
   * every surface DRAWS the rectified projection. The pixels are still cut once,
   * at Finish. Which is exactly what makes *Reopen crops* free: clearing this
   * field costs nothing and destroys nothing, and the project reopens as it was
   * left.

/**
 * WHAT THE BOOK'S PAGES LOOK LIKE WHEN NOBODY HAS SAID OTHERWISE.
 *
 * ── The absence this fills ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `CapturePage.byHand` is not a property of a page. It is a property of what a
 * future button press will do to that page — which is why, for three waves, its
 * control could not be named after an outcome and had to be named after a
 * policy: *"Let apply-to-all change it again"*. Nobody holds policies in their
 * head. They hold objects.
 *
 * Apply-to-all was a verb with no noun. It copied from whichever photograph
 * somebody happened to be standing on and was then gone — there was no *the
 * book's crop* to look at, to return a page to, or to offer a fresh photograph.
 * Every awkward thing on that surface descended from that one absence, including
 * the split line that reset to dead centre on every step, because with no book's
 * cut the only fallbacks were "this photograph's" and "the middle".
 *
 * ── IT IS STORED, AND IT IS ONLY EVER SET THROUGH A PAGE ───────────────────
 *
 * There is no editor for the book's crop and there deliberately is not one: a
 * crop cannot be judged against a page you cannot see, so a "representative
 * photograph" would send a person straight to the awkward frame — where dragging
 * detaches it from the very thing they were trying to set. *Crop all* is the
 * only writer.
 *
 * ── THE SHAPE IS PART OF THE CROP, NOT METADATA ABOUT IT ───────────────────
 *
 * A quad is fractions of a frame, so it only means the same region on a frame of
 * the same proportions. Copied onto a differently shaped photograph the
 * fractions resolve in bounds, plausible, and silently STRETCHED all the way
 * into the finished PDF. `sameShape` is the guard and it needs something to
 * compare against, so the standing carries the frame it was drawn for rather
 * than pointing at a photograph that may since have been removed.

 * during the invoke, the renderer subscribes through preload, and the invoke
 * still answers with the whole result when it finishes.
 *
 * `done` COUNTS FINISHED PHOTOGRAPHS AND `file` NAMES THE ONE IN HAND, so a
 * modal can read "3 of 27 — IMG_0214.HEIC" without arithmetic. `done` is
 * therefore behind `file` by one photograph, which is the honest pairing: the
