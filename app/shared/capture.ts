 * shared/capture — the capture stage's arithmetic, asked once and answered once.
 *
 * The recipe's SHAPES live in shared/types.ts with every other shape; what lives
 * here is the one calculation both sides of the bridge have to agree about. It
 * is pure, it reads nothing, and it is in `shared/` for the same reason
 * `shared/stages.ts` is: two implementations of one rule are two answers waiting
 * to disagree.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists at all, which is a story about one sentence ────────
 *
 * docs/CAPTURE.md pinned the rule as prose — *"Output page size = the quad's
 * opposite-edge maxima"* — and that sentence acquired two implementations within
 * hours: MAIN needs it because `capture:mint-begin` returns `outWidth`/
 * `outHeight` per page, and THE EDITOR needs it because it has to shape a
 * preview while somebody is still dragging corners, long before any mint has
 * been asked for. P2 raised it on the feature channel (seq 25) before the second
 * copy could drift, and the ruling (seq 26) was to move the function here.
 *
 * THE ROUNDING IS THE PART THAT WOULD HAVE DRIFTED. `Math.round` against
 * `Math.floor` is a one-pixel disagreement per page that no typecheck can see
 * and no test would have been written for; the preview and the minted page would
 * have differed slightly on every page of every book, and nobody would have
 * noticed until they compared the two closely. The prose did not say which, and
 * a rule that does not say which is a rule with two readings.

 * `mintBegin` in electron/capture.ts, the light table footer's `mintable`, and

/**
 * WHAT A MINT WOULD BE MADE FROM, as one comparable string.
 *
 * ── The question it exists to answer ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A mint is a snapshot of the recipe, and the recipe goes on being edited
 * afterwards. So the light table's footer has to be able to say — quietly, and
 * only while it is true — that the book on the shelf was minted from an earlier
 * arrangement. Something has to compare what the recipe describes NOW against
 * what the newest mint was made from, and this is that something: main records
 * it on the mint's step, the renderer recomputes it from the recipe it is
 * already holding, and the two strings either match or they do not.
 *
 * ── Why it is not a hash of the recipe file, which is the whole point ───────
 *
 * The recipe holds fields the mint never reads: `byHand`, the photographs'
 * names, and `prepared` — the ticks a person sets on the prepare rail to say
 * they have turned the pages. A fingerprint of the FILE would therefore change
 * the instant somebody ticked a box, and the surface would answer a person who
 * had just said "yes, I turned them" by telling them their book was out of
 * date. A false sentence, in the one surface whose reason for existing is to
 * stop saying false things, produced by the feature standing next to it.
 *
 * So it fingerprints the MINT INPUT instead (`mintPlan`), which by construction
 * moves when and only when the printed book would be arranged differently.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does not answer ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Is this a different ARRANGEMENT", not "would the bytes come out identical".
 * `MINT_DPI` and the JPEG quality live in main, outside this projection, so
 * changing one of them would produce a different PDF from an unchanged
 * arrangement and this string would not move. That is the ruled scope (Wave 21b)
 * and not an oversight: the sentence a person reads says "an earlier
 * arrangement", and a DPI bump lighting every book's footer in the library at
 * once would be the same false sentence, wholesale.
 *
 * ── The fingerprint itself ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * FNV-1a over the canonical rendering, written out here rather than taken from
 * `node:crypto`, because BOTH SIDES OF THE BRIDGE CALL THIS and the renderer has
 * no crypto module; `SubtleCrypto` would answer, but only asynchronously, and
 * this is asked on every edit while somebody is dragging a corner. It is an
 * equality check and not a security primitive — the cost of a collision is one
 * sentence that stays quiet when it could have spoken, and 64 bits over a string
 * this short puts that far below the odds of the file being wrong for any other
 * reason.
 *
 * The separator is written as an ESCAPE and never as a literal byte: a raw NUL
 * in source marks the whole module binary to git and invisible to grep, which

 * a recipe knows which way up a page is meant to be — that is the whole reason
 * "Turn pages" is a tick a person sets rather than a rule anything derives. What
 * this measures is only how far the corner labels have been rotated away from
 * the photograph's own top-left, which is a fact about the file and is exactly
 * what a stamp needs in order to leave a turn alone.
 *
 * ── Why the topmost-then-leftmost corner, rather than the nearest one ───────
 *
 * The corner that reads as the photograph's top-left is the one with the
 * smallest `y`, and the smallest `x` among equals. That is a LEXICOGRAPHIC
 * order on the same two numbers the quad already holds: total, exact, and free
 * of any comparison of magnitudes.
 *
 * The obvious alternative — the corner nearest the origin — needs a distance,
 * and distances tie. A crop symmetric about the diagonal (a diamond, and any
 * square centred on the frame) has two corners the same distance from (0, 0)
 * and no honest way to choose between them, so the answer would depend on a
 * tie-break nobody could predict from looking at the picture. Lexicographic
 * order ties only when two corners are the SAME POINT, which is a degenerate
 * quad rather than a shape somebody drew.
 *
 * ── What it cannot do, said plainly ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A crop tilted more than 45° makes "which corner is the top-left" genuinely
 * ambiguous, and this will answer confidently anyway. That is not a case the
 * editor can produce — a de-skew is a few degrees and a turn is exactly a
 * quarter — but a hand-edited recipe could, and the honest note is that the

 * Put a split back on the page it cuts — RE-SEATED, NOT TRUSTED.

 *
 * A split is stored in working-copy fractions (see `CaptureSplit`), so it is a
 * memory of where two handles were let go, not a promise about the page as it
 * stands now. Drag a crop corner afterwards and the endpoints stay where they
 * were, floating off the edges they were riding. Cutting from those points
 * would produce halves that are not halves of anything: corners outside the
 * crop, black wedges in a minted page.
 *
 * So each endpoint is moved onto the edge nearest it and the cut is taken from
 * there. A split nobody has disturbed seats exactly where it already was, at a
 * cost of eight projections; a stale one is corrected in the only direction
 * that has a defensible answer.
 *
 * ── null means ADJACENT, and adjacent means there is nothing to return ─────
 *
 * Endpoints on opposite edges cut a quad into two quads. Endpoints on adjacent
 * edges cut a CORNER off — a triangle and a pentagon — and the mint can print
 * neither, since rectifying maps four corners onto a rectangle and has no other
 * shape to offer. There is no nearest sensible cut to fall back to, so this
 * refuses and the caller decides what that means: the validator refuses the
 * recipe, the editor leaves the handle where a person can see it is wrong.
 *
 * NOTHING A DRAG PRODUCES CAN LAND HERE. `seatSplit` builds every segment the
 * pointer makes and builds it opposite by construction, so null means a
 * hand-edited file — the same thing a refusal from `validQuad` means, and not

 * The end being dragged is projected onto the edge OPPOSITE the one its partner
 * rides, and the partner is re-seated on its own edge on the way past. Opposite
 * by construction, so the invariant is enforced where the gesture happens
 * rather than restated in the component that draws it. Two statements of one
 * rule would agree until an endpoint reached a corner.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS FORECLOSES HAS ALREADY HAPPENED ONCE IN THIS FEATURE, in the
 * shape a corner drag took before the editor clamped it: the surface let
 * somebody express a state the validator refused, so the crop looked fine and
 * the recipe stopped saving, and the light table went on looking alive for the
 * rest of the session. A gutter that draws and will not save is the same bug
 * with a different handle.
 *
 * ── AND IT LEAVES A PAGE ON EITHER SIDE ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The end is also held back from any position that would cut a page smaller
 * than `SLIVER_FLOOR` of the sheet. THE CORNER IS NOT THE SLIVER, which is the
 * part that makes this arithmetic rather than a clamp: on a leaning cut an end
 * driven all the way onto a corner still leaves a tenth of the sheet beside it
 * — a whole page — while both ends crowding the same side makes a strip with
 * neither of them near a corner. So it is a question about the AREA that comes
 * out, and the old rule about how near an end may get to a corner was only ever
 * right for cuts parallel to the sides.
 *
 * Only the DRAG is held. A `{ x }` being migrated and a fraction from the Split
 * button pass through `splitFromFraction` untouched: reading a file must return
 * what the file says, and a stored sliver is a fact about somebody’s project
 * rather than a gesture to intercept.

 * — the only cut that existed — 2% ALONG THE EDGE IS 2% OF THE AREA. This is
 * the same rule restated in the measure that survives a lean.

 * IT IS A FLOOR AGAINST DEGENERACY, NOT AN OPINION ABOUT HOW A BOOK DIVIDES,

 * calls that are each individually correct and together wrong. The second call
 * clamps against a partner THE FIRST CALL ALREADY MOVED, so each believes a
 * partner that is no longer where its floor was computed for, and the pair walks
 * past a limit neither call thought it was crossing. Measured before this
 * existed: a half of 0.28% of the sheet against a floor of 2%, and past a point
 * a segment `halvesOf` refuses outright, because both ends had reached corners of
 * the same edge and there was no opposite pair left to name.
 *
 * ── AND THE FLOOR WAS MODELLED ON THE GESTURE THAT CANNOT MAKE A SLIVER ────
 *
 * Moving ONE end while the other stays put barely can: the fixed end holds the
 * cut open, which is why a one-end drag pushed to every extreme never brought a
 * half within ten times the floor, and why the first hunt for a case that made
 * the clamp bite could not find one until the other end was crowded by hand. THE
 * SLIDE MOVES THE END THAT WAS DOING THE HOLDING. It is the gesture the floor is
 * actually for, and it was written against the one that is nearly incapable of
 * the failure — the same shape as `{ x }` once more: a rule measured on the case
 * that cannot go wrong.
 *
 * ── The edges are decided ONCE, before anything moves ─────────────────────
 *
 * Each end keeps the edge it was already riding for the whole slide, rather than
 * being re-seated onto whatever edge it drifts nearest. That is what makes the
 * refusal unreachable rather than merely unlikely: opposite in, opposite out, so
 * there is no position of the pointer that leaves `cutOf` with nothing to name.
 *
 * ── Backing off is a bisection, and it is exact because the sweep is ordered ─
 *
 * The one-end solve inverts a straight line. This cannot: seating CLAMPS at the
 * ends of an edge, so with both ends moving the area is piecewise-quadratic in
 * how far the slide has gone rather than affine, and a closed form would be four
 * cases guarding one answer.
 *
 * What holds instead is an ordering: sliding in a fixed direction sweeps the cut
 * across the sheet, so one half grows through the whole slide and the other
 * shrinks, and the SMALLER half’s share rises to the even cut and falls away
 * after it. A single hump means the places where the floor holds form ONE
 * stretch, and the slide starts inside it — so the last position that holds can
 * be halved into exactly, and sixty halvings put it beyond any pixel. The
 * ordering is measured rather than asserted (see the acceptance).

 * The uncut sheet two halves were cut from — the one page a split is a split of.
 *
 * ── Why it takes the split, when it only ever reads the outer corners ──────
 *
 * Reassembling a SIDE-BY-SIDE pair means taking the first half’s left corners
 * and the second’s right ones. Do that to a STACKED pair and the corners it
 * reaches for are on the CUT edge instead of the outside, and what comes back
 * is the sheet with two opposite corners replaced by the two cut points.
 *
 * That result is not a shape anything can detect. Measured on a realistic
 * trapezoid: it is SIMPLE AND CONVEX — no self-intersection to test for — and
 * its area is EXACTLY HALF the sheet’s at every cut position, 0.3536 against
 * 0.7073 at a cut of 0.5 and the same number at 0.3, so an "the area changed"
 * guard passes too. A plausible, printable page of the wrong half of the sheet:
 * in bounds, wrong, and invisible all the way into the PDF, which is the exact
 * class of defect the schema’s own docblock warns about for copied quads.
 *
 * So it cannot be a total function with a sanity check bolted on. It has to
 * KNOW, and the split is the only thing that does.
 *
 * ── It reads the segment’s DIRECTION and never its position ───────────────
 *
 * Which is a narrower read than it looks, and the reason re-seating is not
 * quietly abandoned here: A STALE SEGMENT’S POSITION GOES STALE, ITS DIRECTION
 * DOES NOT. Dragging a crop corner slides the endpoints along the edges they
 * ride; it does not move an endpoint from the top edge to the left one, and it
 * does not turn the cut a quarter. So the segment is asked which of the first
 * half’s two candidate cut edges it lies along — a binary, from a direction —
 * and never asked where anything is.
 *
 * ── With no split at all, the halves are asked instead ────────────────────
 *
 * Two quads and no split line is legal: somebody cropped both halves by hand
 * (the validator says so explicitly). There is no fact to read then, so the
 * two readings are measured — halves of one cut share their cut edge — and the
 * closer one wins. It is an inference, which is why it is the fallback and not
 * the rule.
 *
 * THIS IS ON THE WRITE PATH. `setSplit` derives both half-quads from this and
 * saves them, so a wrong answer here is not a handle in the wrong place: it is
 * two wrong pages in recipe.json and in the PDF minted from it.
