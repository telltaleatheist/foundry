 * THE COMMAND LINE IS ONE ARRAY ON ONE LINE, deliberately: the engine's command
 * for this is new, its flags are still settling, and the whole of this app's
 * dependency on their spelling is the literal below. Nothing else in the renderer
 * or in main knows what the engine is asked; they know the shape of the answer,
 * which is `PdfBlocksOutcome`.
 *
 * `--pdf` is passed on every call although the command marks it optional. It is
 * the fallback for a bank written before runs recorded the size they rendered
 * each page at, and a box measured in the wrong frame is an outline a few per
 * cent away from the block it belongs to — which is invisible until somebody
 * strikes the wrong paragraph. The file is beside us and the flag is free.
 *
 * THE APP NEVER READS THE BANK ITSELF, and that is the rule this exists to obey
 * rather than an implementation detail. `readings/<key>.jsonl` is the model's own
 * record: the engine decides what a block IS (the markdown split into parts, the
 * furniture set aside, the synthesised quotes), and a second reader here would be
 * a second opinion about the identity of every block the overlay names. An
 * amendment targeting `7:14` has to mean the same element in this app and in the
 * conversion that applies it, and the only way to guarantee that is for one
 * program to do the deciding.
 *
 * NOT A REJECTION. "This engine build has no blocks command" and "this book has
 * never been read" are both ordinary answers a person should meet as a sentence
 * in the pane rather than as a broken tab.
