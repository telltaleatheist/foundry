/**
 * book — the book file, made if it is not there, read, and handed to the pane.
 *
 * ── Why this is a module and not four lines in main.ts ──────────────────────
 *
 * Because it is three separate pieces of knowledge that each belong to somebody
 * else, and the only thing this file adds is the ORDER they go in. Where the file
 * lives is `projects.ts`'s (every path in a project is composed there, once, so a
 * branch read cannot end up answering for the other reading's bank). How to run
 * the engine is `engine.ts`'s (this app never imports foundry; it spawns it). What
 * the file's grammar is belongs to `shared/book.ts`, which mirrors the engine's own
 * writer. main.ts registers the door and knows none of it — which is the shape
 * `workspace.ts` already has.
 *
 * ── ENSURING THE FILE IS ALSO THE MIGRATION, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE ─────────
 *
 * Every project in the library predates this format: they hold a bank and no book
 * file at all. Nothing has to be migrated for them, because the book file is
 * DERIVED — the bank is the reset point and the reflow is seconds of arithmetic
 * over it — so "open a read position" and "produce the book file for the first
 * time" are one code path and there is no second one to keep true
 * (docs/RENDERER.md §9, R2).
 *
 * IT IS MADE ONLY WHEN IT IS ABSENT. A book file that exists is the one the ops
 * are keyed to, and re-running the reflow over it because a pane was opened would
 * be this process rewriting the document somebody is editing every time they look
 * at it. Regenerating on purpose is a different gesture and it is not this one.
 *
 * ── AND A TRANSLATION HAS A BOOK FILE OF ITS OWN ────────────────────────────
 *
 * *"When a translate lands, main materializes parent book file + chain ops +
 * records → readings/<key>.<lang>.book.jsonl — same format, parent ids kept
 * verbatim, struck rows absent, text replaced from records. Downstream positions
 * read the NEAREST ancestor book file, so replay is always one short hop."*
 * (docs/RENDERER.md §4.) That file is written HERE, three ways: by the landing
 * the moment the records exist, by a correction appended to those records, and —
 * the ensure posture again — by the first open of a translation recorded before
 * either of those doors existed. The ops replayed on top of it are only the ones
 * made SINCE it (`editsSinceTransform`, shared/ledger.ts); everything above it
 * was baked in when it was written, and replaying those a second time would
 * strike rows that are already gone.
 *
 * ── THE BANK'S IDENTITY IS CHECKED ON EVERY OPEN ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The book file is a pure function of the receipt, and its header carries the
 * receipt's identity (`source.bankSha`, docs/BOOK-FILE.md §2). A loader that
 * finds the bank has changed under the book is holding ids that may name
 * nothing, and the contract's answer is the one given here: REFUSE BY NAME, as
 * a sentence, and let the one door that may rebuild do it as an announced
 * action. That door is the read-landing orchestration's, not this open.
 *
 * ── Every failure is a sentence, and it carries no path ─────────────────────
 *
 * What comes back from here goes onto the paper (RENDERER-DESIGN.md §5: errors
 * render as main's own sentence on the sheet, never a toast), and the house rule
 * is that a filename never appears in copy a person reads. So the sentence names
 * the BOOK's problem and the terminal gets the path — which is where somebody
 * debugging their own library goes looking, and the one place it is any use.

 *
 * Owen exported a captured book on 2026-08-22 and the engine refused: *"is a
 * picture and this book never had its figures cut"*. It was right, and nothing
 * in the app was ever going to fix it — the reflow had run months earlier with
 * no source (its archive is a folder of photographs, and `vlm-book` took only
 * `--pdf` until Wave 37), the book file it wrote is perfectly valid, and the
 * ensure step below sees a valid book file and stops. The one thing that had
 * changed was the ENGINE's ability to cut from those photographs, and a person
 * has no way to ask for a reflow.
 *
 * So the ensure step asks one more question than it used to. This is not a
 * fallback and not a repair pass: it is the same "is the file on the disk the
 * one this project should have" the function has always asked, with a fact in
 * it that only became knowable when the engine learned to record it.
 *
 * ── Two answers, and the second one is a migration ──────────────────────────
 *
 * THE HEADER SAYS SO, for anything a current engine wrote: `from === null` means
 * the run was offered no pages at all, and `blocks > cut` means there were
 * pictures it therefore did not cut. Both, or this book is as good as it can be.
 * Note `from` records the OFFER: a book remade WITH pages says `pages` even if
 * something went wrong afterwards, which is exactly why this terminates.
 *
 * THE ROWS SAY SO, for anything older, and every book file in anybody's library
 * today is older. There is no marker, so the honest reading is "unknown" and the
 * evidence is the rows themselves: a Picture row with no `image` is a picture
 * with no file. That costs one read of a file the caller is about to read again,
 * and it costs it ONCE IN THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT — the remake writes a marker,
 * and every open after that takes the branch above.
 *
 * A FILE THAT WILL NOT PARSE IS NOT THIS FUNCTION'S PROBLEM. It answers false and
 * the load a few lines later refuses it by name, in the parser's own sentence,
 * which is a far better sentence than anything this could say about it.

 * argument one transform along, and it is announced in the log for the same
 * reason: a file appearing in `readings/` is something the person's own terminal
 * should be able to account for.
 *
 * A TRANSLATION WITH NO RECORDS CANNOT BE SHOWN, and that is a sentence rather
 * than a repair. `translationRecordsOf` answers null for a row made by the old
 * EPUB→EPUB translator, whose words exist only inside the book that run wrote —
 * there is no per-block anything to materialise from, and inventing one would
 * mean re-parsing an EPUB into blocks that were never named. The step still has

 *
 * *"Translated edits are per-language record corrections."* (docs/RENDERER.md §5.)
 * The words of a translated block belong to the records file: that file is the
 * step's payload, it is the truth the derived book is a pure function of, and
 * every position under the translation is drawn from that derived book. A `text`
 * op over the same block would put the person's sentence in the ops chain while
 * the records still held the machine's — two accounts of one paragraph, which is
 * precisely the failure `translationWorldOf` was built to prevent one surface over
 * ("mirroring it into the source curation would write Hungarian over the German
 * bank, silently", electron/projects.ts). So the edit goes where the words live.
 *
 * ── THE ID MUST BE A ROW OF THE BOOK FILE, and this is where that is proven ──
 *
 * A record is keyed by a block id and read back by looking that id up in the book
 * being materialised (`translationWords`). The pane can hold ids that book has
 * never had — the halves of an unapplied cut, `b2-3/1` and `b2-3/2`, which exist
 * only in the replay — and a record filed under one of those would be a row that
 * every future materialisation reports as stale and no reader ever finds. It is
 * refused by name instead, with the sentence saying which gesture comes first.
 *
 * ── The order, and what the caller gets back ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Append, re-materialise, re-read. The derived book is stale from the instant the
 * row is appended until it is made again (main's `translation:record-edit` door
 * makes the same pair of calls for the same reason), and the pane cannot draw the
 * corrected words until it is. So the answer is the WHOLE BOOK back — one question,
 * one answer, on `loadBook`'s own rule — rather than an acknowledgement the pane
 * would have to follow with a second round trip.
 *
 * IT REJECTS, on `applyBookOps`'s rule: the person's words are in front of them
 * and a refusal is something they can act on.

 * Every other order has a failure that leaves the project describing something
 * that is not there: a step written first and a disk that then refuses leaves a
 * row in somebody's history naming a payload that does not exist, and
 * `loadBook` above rightly refuses the whole book for it — one full stop, forever,

 * ── Why the ops are re-read after being written out ─────────────────────────

 * rather than by every open of the book from now on.

 * sheet. This is the other case: the person's changes are still on the stack in
 * front of them, so a refusal is something they can act on — and a resolve that

 * is the argument: what is in that folder is a RETAINED PAYLOAD, read again every
 * time a book is opened, and nothing in this app may treat what it finds there as
 * disposable — which is exactly the promise this file needs and exactly the
 * promise `working/` and `overlays/` do not make. A sweep cannot touch it either,
 * and not by luck: `planStepSweep` walks the payloads its doomed STEPS name, and
 * no step will ever name this one.
 *
 * A FIXED NAME AND NOT A UUID, which is the one way it differs from its
 * neighbours. Every other file in there is `<id8>.jsonl`, named after the step
 * that owns it, because there is one per step; there is exactly one working stack
 * per project — the app opens one book tab per project directory and one viewer
 * at a time — so a minted name would be a second thing to look up before the file
 * could be found, and an orphan the day the lookup went missing. Eight hex is
 * eight hex and `pending` is not, so it collides with nothing by construction.

 *
 * A bank is the whole of a book's reading: a few megabytes for a pamphlet and
 * tens of them for anything with pages. `loadBook` hashes it ONCE, when a book is
 * opened, and that cost is invisible beside the read it is part of. The sidecar
 * is written every four hundred milliseconds of somebody striking paragraphs, and
 * re-hashing tens of megabytes on that cadence would put a measurable stall in
 * main between every gesture and the next — for a value that cannot have changed,
 * because the bank a person is editing over is not being rewritten while they
 * edit over it.
 *
 * KEYED BY MTIME AND SIZE, which is the standard trade and it is worth naming
 * what it costs: a rewrite that produced a file of exactly the same length with
 * exactly the same modification time would be missed, and the sidecar would carry
 * the old sha. That is not the app's integrity check and never was —
 * `loadBook`'s is, it is uncached, and it refuses the whole book before a pane
 * ever gets far enough to ask for a recovery. This one is the second gate behind
 * it, and a second gate is allowed to be cheap.

 * history: no step names it, no replay reads it, and standing anywhere in the
 * tree draws the same book whether it exists or not. What it is is the answer to
 * "where is the only copy of the work somebody has not applied yet", which used
 * to be "the renderer's heap, until the window closes".
 *
 * ATOMICALLY, by `applyBookOps`' argument at its own scale: this is written every
 * four hundred milliseconds of somebody's afternoon, so an interrupted write must
 * leave the last whole stack rather than half of the current one. Half a file of
 * ops is a recovery that puts back the first two thirds of an edit.
 *
 * AN EMPTY STACK CLEARS RATHER THAN WRITES. The pane calls this whenever its
 * stack changes and "changed back to nothing waiting" is one of those changes; a
 * file saying "no changes" left lying in `ops/` is a recovery prompt for work
 * that does not exist.
