/**
 * capture — photographs become a project the rest of this app can read.
 *
 * A capture project arrives as pictures of a bound volume rather than as a file
 * (docs/CAPTURE.md). This module owns everything that happens to those pictures
 * BEFORE a PDF exists: copying them in, hashing them, decoding them once, and
 * keeping the recipe of splits and quads that says how they become pages. The
 * mint that turns the recipe into a PDF is the other half and lands later; from
 * the minted PDF onward nothing in this app knows this stage happened.
 *
 * ── THE LAYOUT, AND WHICH HALF OF IT HAS A DOOR ──────────────────────────────
 *
 *   capture/originals/<sha>.<ext>    the bank. Never written, NEVER SERVED
 *   capture/derived/<sha>.png        the upright working copy
 *   capture/derived/<sha>.640.jpg    the thumbnail the grid draws
 *   capture/recipe.json              the splits, quads, strikes and order
 *
 * ONE SERVED DIRECTORY, FLAT NAMES. The renderer reaches pixels only through
 * `foundry-file://capture/<token>/<name>`, whose token maps to `derived/` and
 * whose name must be a plain basename — the same allow-list shape as the book
 * host next door (`bookFigureFile`, electron/book.ts), kept character for
 * character rather than replaced with a cleverer path check that has to stay
 * right forever.
 *
 * The consequence is the reason the layout is this one: NO STRING A RENDERER CAN
 * COMPOSE REACHES THE ORIGINALS. The irreplaceable half of this stage — often
 * the only copy of an afternoon in an archive that does not lend its books — is
 * not merely un-served, it is unaddressable through the scheme. A second host
 * segment, or a token that reached `capture/` itself, would have left the bank
 * one accepted path component away from being readable, guarded by a check
 * instead of by arithmetic.
 *
 * `derived/` and not `working/`, which was the first proposal: `working/` is
 * already a project directory (`WORKING`, electron/projects.ts) holding the live
 * PDF, and one word may not mean two things one folder apart. The name is also
 * true of the contents — everything in it is reconstructible from the originals
 * plus the recipe, which is this stage's first truth, and it makes the deletion
 * rule readable without a comment.
 *
 * ── UPRIGHT IS THE DECODER'S DEFAULT, AND APPLYING ORIENTATION IS A BUG ──────
 *
 * libheif applies the container's `irot` while decoding, so the buffer comes
 * back already upright and this module writes it out unchanged. Applying EXIF
 * Orientation on top would be a DOUBLE ROTATION: measured on the acceptance
 * shoot, it would have turned 26 of 27 photographs 90° wrong — uniformly enough
 * to look deliberate rather than broken. The dependency is pinned to an exact
 * `libheif-js@1.19.8` for that reason: this is decoder behaviour, not format
 * truth, and a caret would let a routine install change it without a person
 * deciding to.
 *
 * DIMENSIONS COME FROM THE DECODER, NEVER FROM EXIF. EXIF says 4032x3024 for a
 * file the decoder hands back as 3024x4032; both are correct about different
 * grids. The recipe, the editor and the mint all live on the DECODED grid, and
 * there is no orientation field anywhere to disagree with it.

/**
 * Work out which pages were set by hand, for a recipe that never said.
 *
 * ── IT IS NOT A GUESS. NOTHING BUT A HAND COULD HAVE MOVED A CORNER ───────
 *
 * A page arrives at the WHOLE FRAME and nothing but a person changes that. A
 * crop stamped over the shoot copies `source.pages[index].quad` across
 * verbatim, so every page a stamp touched holds the IDENTICAL floats. That
 * leaves exactly three states a quad can be in, and only one of them is hands:
 *
 *   the whole frame                    nobody has touched this page
 *   the crop most of its shape share   a stamp put it there
 *   anything else                      A HAND DRAGGED IT
 *
 * ── THE FIRST VERSION ASKED THE SECOND QUESTION ONLY, AND MISSED A SHOOT ──
 *
 * It marked a page whose quad DIFFERED FROM THE MAJORITY, which quietly
 * assumes there is a stamp to differ from. Measured on the project Owen
 * actually has: 25 photographs, 25 DISTINCT QUADS, no two alike — he cropped
 * every page by hand, one at a time, and the largest disagreement between two
 * of them is a tenth of the frame. With no majority anywhere, nothing was
 * marked, and the first APPLY TO ALL of the editor that finally understands
 * hand-work would have erased all twenty-five without naming one of them.
 *
 * The whole frame is what the majority question was reaching for and could not
 * see: an untouched page has a KNOWN quad, so a page can be told from a stamp
 * even when there is no stamp in the project at all. The majority test stays
 * beside it, because a stamped crop is not the whole frame either.
 *
 * ── ONLY WHEN THE FILE HAS NOT SPOKEN, WHICH KEEPS IT A MIGRATION ────────
 *
 * The moment ANY page in the recipe carries the field, the file is one the
 * staged editor has written and every mark in it is a statement rather than
 * an absence. Deriving past that would let an inference overwrite a fact:
 * somebody who hand-sets a page back to exactly the global crop has still set
 * it by hand, and a rule reading only the geometry would quietly unmark it on
 * the next read. So this runs on the way in, like the `{x}` migration beside
 * it, and stops running the first time the file answers for itself.
 *
 * ── EXACT EQUALITY, PER PAGE SLOT, WITHIN ONE SHAPE ──────────────────────
 *
 * Exact, because these floats were copied rather than computed and a
 * tolerance would be inventing a question nobody asked. Per page SLOT,
 * because a stamp copies slot to slot — comparing the halves of split
 * spreads against each other would find the left halves in the majority and
 * mark every right half as hand-set. Within one shape, for the reason
 * apply-to-all skips: a landscape frame’s crop differing from a portrait
 * one’s says nothing about anybody’s hands.
 *
 * ── AND WHERE IT IS UNSURE IT OVER-MARKS ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A group with no single most-common quad is left alone entirely; a group
 * with several roughly equal crops marks everything outside the largest of
 * them, including pages a stamp did put there. THE TWO ERRORS ARE NOT
 * COMPARABLE: over-marking costs a named skip in a notice and one press of
 * the include-them override, and under-marking costs the evening of cropping
 * that the mark exists to protect.

 * The rectifying happens in the renderer because it is a WebGL shader the

 *
 * ONE PAGE AT A TIME ACROSS THE BRIDGE, and each one lands on disk before the

 * one heap to assemble at the end would put the whole book in memory twice, in
 * a process that also has an app in it.
 *
 * THE PAGES ARE STAGED INSIDE THE PROJECT rather than in the system temp
 * directory. A mint interrupted by a crash leaves a numbered directory under
 * `capture/mints/` that nothing reads and the next mint does not touch. That is
 * a visible mess in one folder, which is better than an invisible one in

/**
 * Take photographs out of the project — the recipe, the pixels and the bank.
 *
 * ── REMOVAL IS NOT A STRIKE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE FEATURE ────────
 *
 * A strike keeps the photograph and leaves it out of the mint: it is a decision
 * about the BOOK, and it is reversible by looking at the grid and changing your
 * mind. This is a decision about the PROJECT — Owen dragged in the wrong files
 * and wants them gone. So everything goes together: the recipe entry, its pages
 * out of `order`, the derived working copy and thumbnail, AND the original in
 * the bank. Leaving any of those behind would orphan it: a file no recipe names,
 * that nothing will ever delete, in a directory whose whole promise is that
 * everything in it is accounted for.
 *
 * ── DELETING THE BANK IS SAFE TO SAY OUT LOUD, WHICH IS WHY WE SAY IT ───────
 *
 * Everywhere else in this stage the bank is sacred — it is the irreplaceable
 * half, and the door cannot even address it. It is deletable HERE and only here
 * because it holds COPIES: the files the person dragged in still exist wherever
 * they dragged them from. The confirm dialog says exactly that, with the count,
 * before any of this runs. This function does not ask; the surface has already
 * asked, and a door that re-asked would be a second opinion about a decision
 * somebody already made.
 *
 * ── REFUSED MID-MINT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A mint holds a list of working copies it is part way through rasterizing. A
 * photograph vanishing under it would be a book quietly short a leaf, or a read
 * of a file that is no longer there — the first is invisible and the second is a
 * crash. Neither is worth allowing so that somebody can tidy up eight seconds
 * earlier.
 *
 * ── AN ID THAT NAMES NOTHING IS NOT AN ERROR ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The surface sends ids off the grid it drew; by the time they arrive one may
 * already be gone (two windows, a repeated Delete). Deleting something already
 * deleted is SUCCESS — the world is in the state that was asked for. Refusing
 * the whole batch for one stale id would strand the other twenty-six.
