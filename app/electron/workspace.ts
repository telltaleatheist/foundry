/**
 * workspace — which file inside which project a job is about to write.
 *
 * The OCR dialog used to ask for an output path. It no longer does, and this is
 * the module that made that possible: every conversion writes into the PROJECT
 * for the document it was run on, opens in a tab the moment it finishes, and is
 * copied out of there only when the user presses Save As. Nothing is ever
 * written beside the source PDF, so a folder of scans stays a folder of scans.
 *
 * This file used to own the naming too — a flat `<libraryDir>/workspace/` and a
 * key derived from the source's content. The key is unchanged and the reasons
 * for it are unchanged; both moved to electron/projects.ts, which is now the one
 * module that decides where anything lives. What is left here is the two
 * questions a JOB asks, and the answers are three paths inside one folder.
 *
 * ── Into `generated/`, unless it is terminal ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * What the engine writes is an ORIGIN, not a working copy: it is the record of
 * what the model actually read, every curation decision downstream is measured
 * against it, and "start over" means unpacking a fresh working tree from it. So
 * a conversion writes into `generated/` and nothing ever writes there again —
 * a second run of the same book rotates the first aside rather than replacing
 * it (electron/projects.ts, `rotateGenerated`).
 *
 * AN EXPORT IS THE EXCEPTION AND IT PROVES THE SENTENCE. `planExport` runs the
 * identical rendering and aims it at `final/`, because what comes out is not an
 * origin: nothing is ever made from it, no working tree is unpacked from it, and
 * no step in anybody's history points at it. The user's ruling is what draws the
 * line — "it wont go into the working files as a step because it isnt the base for
 * new steps. its a terminal step. so its an export." Two plans, one composition,
 * and the layer is the whole of the difference.
 *
 * The FILE is named for the book and not for its role:
 * `Working Towards The Fuhrer. Kershaw, Ian. (1993).epub`, beside the `.pdf` of
 * the same name. The slug is for the project's directory and nothing else.
 *
 * ── The readings bank ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `--readings` is passed on EVERY job, always. Not a checkbox: there is no
 * version of "read three hundred pages again because the window closed" that
 * anyone wants.
 *
 * WHICH BANK IS A QUESTION NOW, and it used to be a fact. It was
 * `<project>/readings/<key>.jsonl` composed from the key at both plans, on the
 * belief that a project has one bank — and a re-read asking for a different page
 * range branches by design, so a project can hold two readings and both of them
 * named that one file. Neither plan composes it any more: a rendering asks the
 * step at the position which bank its row is about, and `planReading` decides
 * whether this reading replaces one that exists or gets a bank of its own. Both
 * answers come from electron/projects.ts, which is the module that decides where
 * anything lives.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED IS WHICH JOB IT IS THE PRODUCT OF. There are two plans below
 * because there are two jobs: `planReading` names the bank an OCR run FILLS, and
 * the rendering plans name the file written out of a bank that already exists.
 * They were one function while reading and writing were one act, and
 * that is precisely what made the output format a question somebody had to
 * answer before a single page had been read.
 *
 * A rendering passes `--reuse-readings` with it (electron/job-queue.ts), which
 * is the flag that keeps it free. Without it the engine treats a completed bank
 * beside its marker as a book to read AGAIN — its own rule, and the right one
 * for a command line, but the wrong answer to somebody pressing a button
 * labelled with a file format.
 *
 * The bank living IN the project also fixes something the flat layout got wrong
 * by accident. The engine's completion marker is named FOR ITS BANK —
 * `<key>.completed.json`, beside `<key>.jsonl` — and it did not always used to
 * be: it was once a bare `completed.json` in the bank's directory, so a folder
 * holding every book's bank held exactly one marker, belonging to whichever run
 * happened to finish last. One bank per directory would have fixed that on its
 * own; the engine fixed it properly by naming the marker after the thing it is
 * about (src/vlm/readings.ts), and this app reads it under that name
 * (`readingState`).

 * splitting the front door. A reading has no output file, so there is no name to
 * compose and no `generated/` predecessor to rotate aside; it has no format, so
 * there is no extension for a `--format` to contradict. What it has is a source

 *
 * IT STILL RESOLVES THE PIXELS ITSELF, which is the one thing both plans share
 * and the reason neither of them takes the user's word for the input. Somebody
 * points at "the PDF", meaning the one this app shows them — and after a
 * real-text rendering that document is type on blank paper with no photograph in
 * it at all. Reading THAT would be reading a reprint of a reading. So the source
 * is `archive/`, always, and the person asking never has to know there is more
 * than one copy.
 *
 * The directories are made here rather than by the engine, because the engine is
 * handed a path and a path whose parent does not exist is a run that dies after

 * Because a bank is not a thing anybody can look at, and the flowing book is

 * anybody pressing anything.
 *
 * ── PDF, always, and keyed to the step rather than to the position ──────────
 *
 * A facsimile is the only thing this plan can be: `--format pdf` reprints the
 * scan's own photographed lines, which is a statement about the READING and not
 * about any state of the book downstream of it. And it is keyed to the step
 * because a project can hold two readings — a re-read asking for a different

 * to replay would reprint whichever reading the pointer happened to be under
 * while the name said this one. Both halves of that agreement are made here:
 * `readingBank` resolves the step's own payload, and `facsimileFile` names the
 * file after the same step.
 *
 * IT COMPILES FROM THE RAW BANK AND FROM NOTHING ELSE (§6) — no decisions, no
 * ops, no edits. A facsimile is the record of what was READ, and a page-for-page

/**
 * Where this book's EXPORT goes — the same rendering, aimed at `final/`.
 *
 * ── One run, two landings, and which of them this is ────────────────────────
 *
 * An export IS a Generate. Same bank, same curation, same `--format`, same
 * translate stage when the position stands under a translation — everything that
 * reaches a command line is identical, which is why it is composed by the same
 * function above rather than by a second copy of that composition. The user's
 * ruling is about what happens AFTERWARDS: "it wont go into the working files as a
 * step because it isnt the base for new steps. its a terminal step. so its an
 * export." So the file lands in the project's tray instead of in the layer this
 * app treats as an origin, and the queue records a `ProjectFinal` row rather than a
 * step on a chain (`GenerateRequest.export`).
 *
 * ── What `final/` does not owe, and why that is not laxity ──────────────────
 *
 * `generated/` is rotated aside rather than replaced, catalogued as a chain,
 * unpacked into working trees, and REFUSED while a tab is reading one of those
 * trees. Only the first of those follows an export into the tray, and it follows it
 * for its own reason (`rotateFinal`): the name is composed from the book, so
 * exporting twice writes one path twice, and a second run silently overwriting the
 * first is the failure the rotation exists to prevent wherever a name is composed
 * rather than chosen. The refusal does NOT follow, because there is no working tree
 * hanging off a filed document for a rename to pull out from under anybody — and a
 * refusal here would stop somebody exporting the book they are looking at, which is
 * the most ordinary reason to export at all.
 *
 * ── AND IT IS THE ONE RENDERING THAT COMPILES THE EDITED BOOK ───────────────
 *
 * *"Export → materialize (replay) → engine compiles EPUB/txt."* (docs/RENDERER.md
 * §6.) A position with applied changes on the way to it used to be refused here,
 * because the engine builds from the pages that were read and the changes live
 * beside them — so the book that came out would have had none of them in it. It
 * is not refused any more: main replays the chain into a derived book file and
 * the engine compiles THAT (`vlm-compile`), which is what makes a person who
 * struck forty running heads and pressed Export get a book without them.
 *
 * The other renderings still refuse, each for its own reason — see
 * `refuseOverEdits` — and a FACSIMILE export never touches any of this: it
 * reprints the reading's own pages from the raw bank, which is a statement about
 * what was read rather than about any state of the book downstream of it.
 *
 * ── The refusals it DOES keep, verbatim ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The reading has to be finished, said in the same words about the same bank: an
 * export that quietly resumed a half-read book would put a vision model behind a
 * button labelled with a file format, which is the rule this whole layer is built
 * around (`--reuse-readings`, docs/DERIVED-BOOK.md §7). And a position standing
 * under a translation can only be exported as an EPUB, because there is no version

 * ── Why a refusal is the only honest answer here ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The engine's `vlm-convert` compiles a book out of a readings bank and a
 * curation. It has never heard of the op grammar and it is never going to: the
 * changes a person makes on the proof sheet are ops in the ledger, replayed by
 * one implementation that lives in this process (docs/RENDERER.md §9, R1). So a
 * rendering that went down that route from a position with edit steps on its path
 * would run perfectly and produce a document with none of those changes in it —
 * the strikes back, the retyped sentences reverted, the relabelled headings as the
 * model first read them — and nothing on screen saying so. That is the worst
 * outcome available: silent, plausible, and discovered in a finished file.
 *
 * ── AND WHAT THE ROOT FIX TOOK OFF IT, TWICE ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * *"A person who struck forty running heads and pressed Export would file a book
 * that still has them."* Not any more: an EXPORT to EPUB or to plain text goes
 * through the compile now (`planExport`), in either language, so the sentence
 * this refusal was written to prevent is prevented by making the book properly
 * instead. And a TRANSLATION no longer comes here at all: `planTranslation`
 * materialises the position's book and the engine translates that file
 * (`translate --book`), so the strikes reach the model's input rather than being
 * faithfully translated into an edition of paragraphs somebody deleted.
 *
 * What still comes here is ONE rendering, and after R6 it is the only one left:
 *
 *  - A FACSIMILE, which reprints the scan's own photographed lines page for page.
 *    It is a record of the READING and compiles from the raw bank by definition
 *    (§6); there is nothing about an edit for it to carry.
 *
 * GENERATE used to be the other, and it is not a case this function lost — it is
 * a product that no longer exists. Its output was the `generated/` CAST, a
 * workbench EPUB carrying the very editing stamps an edition withholds, made so
 * that a pane had a file to unpack and show. The workbench renders the book file
 * directly now, so nothing needs a cast and the button that asked for one went
 * with the surface it fed (docs/RENDERER.md §7).
 *
 * ── ONE CHOKE POINT, NOT ONE PER BUTTON ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `planRendering` is where every rendering in this app is composed — Generate,
 * Export, a landing's own cast, a facsimile — and every door in the UI goes
 * through it. Refusing at the buttons instead would be five copies of this rule
 * and a sixth door somebody adds without it.
 *
 * ── ASKED OF THE STEP WHEN THE PLAN IS ABOUT ONE ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `planRendering`'s own rule, and it keeps this from firing where it must not. A
 * read landing's facsimile is keyed to the read step, whose ancestry is the import
 * and itself — an edit made afterwards is a CHILD of that row and not an ancestor
 * of it — so the automatic reprint is never refused by an edit somebody makes
 * later. A save's cast under an edit chain IS refused, and rightly: that book
 * would be the same lie with a step's name on it, and `castStepBook` already
 * treats a plan it cannot make as a console line rather than a failed save
 * (electron/job-queue.ts).
 *
 * NAMED BY THE ROW, like every refusal in this function, and never by a file.

   * `pipeline.translate === null`, because a translation's words lived in a
   * records file keyed to the bank's own positions and there was no way to put

   * words in the language that was asked for (§4) — and `materializeBook` opens
   * THAT at any position under it. So an export from under a translation with
   * edits on the way to it compiles the translated book with the edits in it,

   * What paid for it: the second route was reachable only through a curation
   * file, and there are no curation files any more (docs/RENDERER.md §7), so

 * The translation's own words and the language they are in — or a refusal naming

 *
 * ── What this replaced ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A second engine run. The book was rendered into a nameless EPUB in the OS temp
 * directory and handed to `translate`, which read it and wrote the real file; an
 * export added a THIRD run to tidy what came back into an edition, because
 * `translate` reads the very stamps an edition withholds. All of that was the cost
 * of a translation being a FILE. It is a records file now, so the translated book
 * is CAST by the same run that assembles every other book — the records go in at
 * the one point where a block's words are written, upstream of the format fork and
 * upstream of the edition rules — and the temp directory, the splice, the tidy and
 * the second bank all go with the change.
 *
 * ── The three refusals, all of them at plan time ────────────────────────────
 *
 * NO FACSIMILE. The PDF route reprints the PAGE — the scan's own photographed
 * lines, set back as type — and there is nowhere in it for a translated paragraph
 * to go; the engine refuses the pair by name for the same reason
 * (src/vlm/convert.ts). What CAN be made from here is the EPUB and the plain text,
 * which is one product more than the two-stage pipeline could offer: that one
 * ended in `translate`, which reads a book and writes a book, so the text route
 * was unreachable through it. Records reach the text emitter because they are
 * substituted before the format fork.
 *
 * A LANGUAGE IT NEVER RECORDED. A translation migrated out of the old catalogue
 * carries no `params.language`, because the language survived only inside a
 * filename and reading a fact out of one is what this codebase's oldest house rule
 * forbids. There is nothing to declare the cast as, and guessing from the
 * parentheses in its name is the one thing this app will not do.
 *
 * A TRANSLATION THAT PREDATES RECORDS. Its answers are a bank keyed by the masked
 * XHTML of a book, and the masking moved a stage earlier when records arrived
 * (`KEY_FORMAT`, src/translate/bank.ts) — so every key in it misses by design, and
 * a run that read it would re-ask the model for the whole book while claiming to
 * be arithmetic. The honest answer is the sentence: that row still has the EPUB it
 * made, standing on it still shows that book, and translating again from the step
 * it was made from puts the project on records for good.

 *
 * It wrote `generated/<book> (hu).epub`: a second EPUB, same container, same

 * `readings/<key>.hu[.<id8>].records.jsonl` now — one row per flowing block,

 * The book a person reads is CAST from those records afterwards, by the same
 * `vlm-convert` that assembles every other book in this app.
 *
 * Three things this function used to owe went with the EPUB. There is no
 * `.epub` extension to keep load-bearing (nothing opens a records file in a tab).
 * There is no previous edition to rotate aside, and therefore no rotation refusal
 * and no self-overwrite case — this run writes into `readings/`, where nothing is
 * ever unpacked and no tab is ever pointed. And there is no separate bank: the
 * records file IS the cache, which is why the engine refuses `--bank` beside
 * `--records` by name.
 *
 * ── AND IT MAY BE A CHAIN, WHICH THE LEDGER DECIDES AND NOBODY ELSE ────────
 *
 * The user: *"if they click the english translation and then click translate to
 * hungarian, it translates from english to hungarian."* Standing under a
 * translation, this run's questions are asked of the PARENT'S answers rather than
 * of the book's own words — `--source-records`, plus `--from` naming the language
 * those answers are in. Both are read off the nearest translate step on the

   * off the same reading, and `translationInEffect` correctly refuses to find it —
   * it is not on the path from the import to where that save stands.
   *
   * IT IS SAFE FOR THE PARENT'S OWN REASON: a records row is keyed by the block's
   * own text and remembered by the block's own position, so a sibling's answer

   * questions this run will not ask, and every one of them would be re-asked
   * anyway. Copying a file to gain nothing is a file copied for nothing.

/**
 * The immutable original this project was made from, or null for a legacy one.

 * `archive/` is written exactly once, by `importDocument`, and by nothing else
 * ever. That makes it the source of record: the bytes the user handed over,
 * unedited, however many conversions have since been run over them.
 *
 * NULL IS A REAL ANSWER, not an error. A project adopted from the old flat
 * workspace has outputs and no archive — nobody kept the scan, because the old
 * layout had nowhere to keep it — and the honest fallback for those is the
 * document the caller was pointing at. It is what that project has.
 *
 * ── Why there is no refusal anywhere near here ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * `refuseSelfOverwrite` used to live in this file and it is gone. It compared
 * the input path with the output path and threw when they matched, which could
 * happen because the user was allowed to point the engine at a file this app
 * had filed in `generated/`. That is a guard against a state the architecture
 * should never be able to reach, and a guard like that documents the
 * architecture failing rather than protecting anybody: the person who met it had
 * asked for something perfectly reasonable and was told to go and choose a
 * different file because of where their conversions were being kept.
 *
 * Two invariants replace it, and both are properties of how paths are BUILT:
 *
 *   THE ARCHIVE IS NEVER A WRITE TARGET. Every output path in this app is
 *   composed by `planExport` or `planTranslation`, and both compose into
 *   `generated/`. Nothing anywhere composes one into `archive/`.
 *
 *   THE USER IS ALWAYS IN A WORKING COPY. What they point at is a copy the app
 *   made and may replace, so applying a change to it is always allowed. There is
 *   no case left where this app knows better than the person who asked.
 *
 * The ENGINE keeps its own `--out == --pdf` refusal (src/vlm/convert.ts), and
 * that one is not this one: it belongs to a command-line program anyone may hand
 * two arbitrary paths, and it protects a run from destroying the input it is
 * reading halfway through. This app simply never hands it such a pair.

 * now asked at the moment of rotating, in electron/job-queue.ts, and it is asked
 * there with the same case-folded resolve — the per-module path fold this
 * codebase keeps beside whoever needs it (electron/recents.ts has its own, so
 * does electron/overlays.ts). A copy left here would be a helper for nobody.
