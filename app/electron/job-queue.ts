/**
 * job-queue — the conversions, owned by MAIN.
 *
 * It lives here and not in the renderer for the same reason BookForge's stages
 * do: an ng-serve reload, or a user navigating to Settings, must not be able to
 * kill ninety minutes of GPU. The renderer holds a MIRROR, pushed on every
 * change; it never holds the truth.
 *
 * SERIAL, always. The engine loads a document vision model and holds a GPU for
 * the length of a book; two of them on one machine is two runs that each take
 * twice as long, or an out-of-memory failure at page 200. `pump()` starts the
 * next queued job only when nothing is running.
 *
 * A job that reads through the LOCAL vLLM endpoint waits for that server first
 * (electron/vllm-server.ts). The wait is part of the job, not a thing that
 * happens beside it: the shelf says "Starting the reading server…", and a
 * server that will not start fails THAT job with the guest's own log tail.
 *
 * ── Nothing EXPENSIVE starts until the user says so ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A READING is enqueued HELD. It sits in the list, in order, visible, and does
 * nothing until `start()` releases it. `pump()` only ever claims a `queued` job,
 * so the gate is the state itself rather than a flag anything has to remember to
 * check.
 *
 * THE POINT IS THE BATCH. Enqueueing used to pump immediately, which made the
 * moment of configuring the moment of commitment: the first conversion was
 * already reading pages before the second book could be chosen, so "queue these
 * four and let them run overnight" was not a thing this app could do. `start()`
 * releases everything held AT THAT MOMENT and nothing else — a job added after
 * the press is held again, because Start means "run what is here" and a button
 * that silently also armed the future would make the next enqueue a surprise.
 *
 * A RENDERING IS NOT HELD, and the exception is the rule stated properly. The
 * hold exists so that hours of GPU are never spent by the act of configuring
 * them. A `vlm-convert --reuse-readings` over a finished bank spends no GPU at
 * all: it is arithmetic over answers already on the disk, it is offline, it
 * takes seconds, and it can be asked for again as often as somebody likes. There
 * is nothing to commit to, so there is nothing for Start to mean — and a person
 * who pressed Generate and then had to find this shelf and press another button
 * would be confirming a decision they had already made. It is still QUEUED
 * rather than run beside whatever is going: one engine at a time is a fact about
 * the machine, and it holds however cheap the job is.
 *
 * ── NO JOB IN HERE STARTS ANOTHER ONE ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every row in this queue arrives from a person pressing something. A reading
 * that lands makes ONE document nobody asked for — its book file — and even that
 * is not a job: `vlm-book` is arithmetic over a bank already on the disk, no
 * model, no GPU, no server, so `landReadProducts` spawns it and awaits it inside
 * the settle, which is the same posture `loadBook` (electron/book.ts) takes when
 * a pane opens a book nothing has reflowed. The user: "from that bank, we
 * create an html page of the document - a proto epub. that's the step that appears
 * automatically the moment i OCR something."
 *
 * THE FACSIMILE USED TO ARRIVE HERE TOO, enqueued by the read arm the instant a
 * bank was marked complete, and it was there as insurance rather than as a
 * convenience. It dates from before the bank was kept unconditionally: a
 * page-for-page reprint already on the disk was the one record of a reading that
 * nothing downstream could invalidate. The bank is now kept whatever happens, so
 * the thing that reprint was standing in for is the thing that survives, and
 * making the reprint again is seconds of offline arithmetic over answers that are
 * still there. That turns it into a document somebody ASKS for — Export →
 * Facsimile PDF, or any other door onto `planRendering` — rather than one a
 * landing leaves in a folder, and it leaves this queue with nothing in it that
 * starts a job of its own.
 *
 * ── Environment installs share this queue, and are NOT held ──────────────────
 *
 * An `env-install` row is not a conversion, but it belongs here rather than
 * beside here. It is long, it is cancellable, and — the reason that decides it —
 * a conversion that needs the environment must wait BEHIND it. One serial queue
 * gives that ordering for free, where a downloader running alongside would let a
 * run start against the Python it is halfway through replacing.
 *
 * IT STARTS ON ITS OWN, WHICH IS THE ONE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE ABOVE, and the
 * reason is that it ALREADY HAD ITS START GESTURE. An install arrives from a
 * user pressing Install in Settings, or from the startup provisioner deciding
 * the app cannot work without it — both are explicit, and neither leaves a
 * person wondering what they are waiting for. Holding one would put a second
 * button between somebody and a download they just asked for, and would let the
 * startup provisioner queue five gigabytes that then sat there until a shelf the
 * user has never opened was expanded and pressed. The batch this file exists to
 * make possible is a batch of BOOKS; an install is plumbing.
 *
 * ── A HOST MAY OWN THE SCHEDULING, AND THIS FILE SPLITS IN TWO FOR IT ────────
 *
 * Owen ruled it (docs/PLAN.md, Wave 16): *"we need to centralize the queue in
 * bookforge."* One machine's GPU needs one owner, and hosted there are two
 * schedulers — this one and the host's, which knows nothing about it.
 *
 * So the file has always been two things in one body: a SCHEDULER that decides
 * which row goes next, and an EXECUTOR that turns a row into an engine run and a
 * landing. They are two functions now. `pump()` is the scheduler and is
 * unchanged in what it does; `executeJob()` is everything that used to happen
 * after the row was chosen, and `runJob()` is the second door onto it — execute
 * THIS, now, because somebody else did the deciding.
 *
 * THE DIVISION IS: THEY DECIDE WHEN, WE STILL DO THE WORK. A host's queue never
 * reimplements the ledger writes, the bank, the rotations or the export landings,
 * because two copies of that bookkeeping is how two apps start disagreeing about
 * what a book is. A job ordered by the host is minted as a row here, runs through
 * the same `executeJob`, lands the same products and publishes the same
 * announcements. What disappears in hosted mode is the WAITING — the row is born
 * `running`, because the waiting already happened in somebody else's list.
 *
 * ROUTED VERSUS INTERNAL IS A DOOR, NOT A FLAG. Every exported gesture in this
 * file is either a door a PERSON reached through the window (`enqueue`,
 * `enqueueTranslate`, `cancel`, `remove`, `start`, `clearFinished` — these route
 * when a host queue is registered) or a door FOUNDRY ITSELF reached for
 * (`enqueueHere`, `cancelHere`, `enqueueEnvInstall`, `runJob` — these never
 * route). Nothing below the doors consults anything: `pump`, `executeJob` and
 * every landing are the same code in both worlds, so there is no flag for a
 * function to forget.

 * that go?" is pointed at. For most jobs it is the document the run writes. For
 * the two whose real product is not a document it is that product instead:
 *
 * - **A READING PRODUCES ITS BANK.** `vlm-read` writes no document at all —
 *   `readings/<key>.jsonl` is the expensive, irreplaceable thing the hours of
 *   GPU bought, and everything a person eventually reads is generated from it
 *   afterwards for nothing.
 * - **A TRANSLATION PRODUCES ITS RECORDS.** Since D2 a translate run writes
 *   per-block answers rather than a book; the book is materialised from them by
 *   a cast that costs seconds. So the records file is what collides, what is
 *   worth showing, and what the row is.
 * - **EVERYTHING ELSE PRODUCES ITS OUTPUT**, which is the ordinary case and
 *   needs no argument.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT THREE CORRECT COPIES ─────────────────────
 *
 * It was three, and all three were right: `enqueueHere`, `enqueueTranslate` and

 * reach. Three correct copies of one rule is a defect with a delay on it — the
 * day the rule gains a fourth kind, or one copy is edited under time pressure,
 * the copies stop agreeing and NOTHING FAILS LOUDLY. The failure is a dedupe
 * that quietly matches the wrong row.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. BookForge — Foundry's host, over the same queue
 * shape — shipped exactly this defect: `readingsPath ?? outputPath`, which made
 * every rendering dedupe against the READ that fills the same bank, so a person
 * pressing Generate got handed the hours-long reading row instead of a
 * conversion. Their own diagnosis, kept here in their words because it is the
 * whole reason this function exists: *"I had written the correct rule once and
 * the wrong rule twice, three functions apart."*
 *
 * So the rule lives here, the three callers ask, and there is no second place
 * for it to be true in a slightly different way. It takes the WIDE request type
 * on purpose — `enqueueHere` can only ever hand it a `JobRequest` and
 * `enqueueTranslate` only ever a `TranslateRequest`, and narrowing the parameter
 * to fit either one would put the fork back where it came from.

 * this window (`exportEpubFromStep`, electron/mount.ts) has to hear "the engine

 * settles, it is simply gone — and a caller waiting on it would wait forever.
 * What it hears is this, with the row's own state on it, which is honest: this
 * job left the queue without producing anything.
 *
 * MANY LISTENERS, unlike the two above, and they unsubscribe. Each waiter is
 * about ONE job and lives for as long as that job does, so a single slot would

 * ── THE MINT ROW, WHICH IS A ROW AND NOT A JOB THE PUMP RUNS ────────────────
 *
 * A mint is minutes of work and it belongs on the shelf with progress and a

 *
 * WHY NOT, PRECISELY. `pump` runs one job at a time (`running !== null` is the
 * whole gate), and that serialisation exists because the engine is one process
 * against one GPU: two reads at once are slower than two reads in a row. A mint
 * is neither — the rasterizing happens in the RENDERER, driven by a person who
 * is watching it, and main only assembles what arrives. Putting it in the slot
 * would mean a read queued behind somebody cropping photographs waits for them
 * to finish, and a mint queued behind a read cannot start until the GPU does,
 * which for an interactive stage reads as the button being broken.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM IS THE STATE AND NOT A FLAG. `pump` selects `state === queued`
 * and nothing else, so a row born `running` is invisible to it — no exclusion
 * list to keep up to date, no second gate to remember. The same trick the hold
 * uses in reverse, and it means a mint and a read genuinely run at once.
 *
 * `env-install` is the precedent for a row the OCR panel never enqueued, and
 * this departs from it in exactly one way: an install DOES take the slot
 * (`pump` dispatches it), because an install and a read compete for the same
 * disk and the same network. A mint competes with nothing.

  /*
   * ── AN EXPORT CARRIES THE RECORD THE PERSON TYPED ─────────────────────────
   *
   * A metadata edit is a step, and the reason it had to become one is exactly
   * this: an export is cast fresh from the bank, the corrections went into the
   * OPF of a working tree, and the working tree is not one of a cast's inputs —
   * so a title corrected in the dialog was silently ABSENT from the book that
   * landed in `final/`. The chain of patches on this position's ancestry is
   * merged (`metadataForProduct`, electron/projects.ts) and applied to the
   * product as the last thing that happens to it.
   *
   * ── Why a stage after, and not a flag on the run that makes the book ──────
   *
   * `vlm-convert` builds the package from the bank and has no notion of a record
   * somebody typed a fortnight later; teaching it one would put the ledger inside
   * the engine. `epub-meta` and `pdf-meta` already do exactly this to a finished
   * file, are already how the dialog writes, and are the same two commands whose
   * refusals the user has already seen.
   *
   * ── Which makes AN intermediate, and it is not avoidable ──────────────────
   *
   * Both commands refuse to write over their input, and both are right to:
   * `pdf-meta` re-emits the whole document through pdf-lib, so an `--out` equal to
   * `--pdf` would destroy the file being read while it was being read. So the
   * engine aims here and the metadata stage lands the destination — which also
   * means a run that gets this far and then cannot stamp the record leaves NO file
   * in the tray, rather than one the user would reasonably believe carries their
   * corrections.
   *
   * NULL FOR EVERY GENERATE, and for an export whose ancestry recorded nothing.
   * `generated/` is the workbench and its casts are re-made constantly; stamping
   * one would be bookkeeping applied to a file nobody keeps.
   *
   * PLAIN TEXT CARRIES NO RECORD AT ALL and is skipped by name: a `.txt` has
   * nowhere to put a title, and there is no third command that would pretend
   * otherwise.
   */
  /*
   * THE PATCH ITSELF, READ ONCE. It used to be read straight into flags for the
   * stamping stage, which is still where it goes for an EPUB or a PDF — but the

   * (`argsFor`), because a book file has no PDF behind it to take a title from,
   * and a plain-text export has no stamping stage at all and therefore had no way

   * rotation used to happen when the job was PLANNED — before it was enqueued,
   * let alone run — and the new file was recorded only if the run succeeded. So
   * a rendering that failed, or was cancelled, or was removed from the queue
   * without ever starting, left the previous output in an archive folder with
   * the catalogue's chain pointing at it and nothing live at all. The row went
   * on listing and opening, and what it opened was silently the run before last,
   * forever.
   *
   * Here, the engine is the next thing that happens. The window between this
   * rename and the first byte written is one spawn — and even that window is
   * covered, because a settle that is not a success puts the rotation back
   * (`restoreRotation`), so the invariant is flat: A RUN THAT PRODUCES NOTHING
   * LEAVES THE CATALOGUE EXACTLY AS IT WAS.
   *
   * NEITHER OF THE TWO JOBS THAT WRITE INTO `readings/` ROTATES, and that is now
   * one rule rather than a reading's exception. A reading fills its BANK and a
   * translation fills its RECORDS; both live beside each other in a directory this
   * block has no business in, both are named per step so nothing is ever
   * overwritten, and both have the engine's own replace-on-success rule underneath
   * them (docs/BANK-LIFECYCLE.md §2). Rotating on their basename would move a file
   * out of `readings/` on the strength of a name that means something else there.
   *
   * THE TRANSLATION USED TO ROTATE, and losing that is losing nothing: what it
   * rotated was the EPUB it was about to overwrite, and it does not write an EPUB
   * any more. The self-overwrite case went with it — a re-translation into the
   * language a document already was named one path twice, so the run read the copy
   * the rotation had moved aside — because a records file is never also the book
   * being read.
   *
   * A refusal here fails the job with its own sentence. Both plans ask the same
   * question while the dialog is still on screen, so this is reached only when a
   * tab was opened on the previous output in between — which is the case only the
   * second answer can authorize.
   *
   * AN EXPORT ROTATES ITS OWN FOLDER, and getting this wrong would be the worst
   * outcome in the file. `rotateGenerated` takes a BASENAME and looks for it in
   * `generated/` — and an export of the book is called `<stem>.epub`, which is
   * exactly the name the project's cast book already has one folder over. Handed
   * to the wrong rotation, asking for a copy of your book would file the book
   * itself into an archive folder and unpack nothing in its place. So the layer
   * decides the rotation, off the one flag that was resolved above, and `final/`
   * gets its own pair (`rotateFinal` / `restoreFinalRotation`) rather than a
   * parameter on this one — the two put back different things.

 *
 * ── What it is for ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A host that keeps its own queue (`FoundryHostQueue`) takes over the DECIDING
 * and nothing else. Its pump reaches this: here is a request, here is the
 * position it was ordered from, run it. There is no waiting, no hold, no place
 * in this app's list — the waiting already happened, in a list this app cannot
 * see, and asking a person to press Start twice would be the hold applied to a
 * commitment somebody already made.
 *
 * ── IT STILL MINTS A ROW, AND THAT IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART ─────────────────
 *
 * The obvious shortcut — spawn the engine, resolve — would break the host's own
 * narrate. A ROW is what carries `parentStep` into the landing, what
 * `onExportLanded` is composed from, what `onJobSettled` publishes, what
 * `exportEpubFromStep` awaits, and what the delete guards and `foundryBusy` count
 * when somebody asks whether a folder is safe to erase. So a job the host
 * scheduled gets exactly the same row a job somebody pressed for gets — born
 * `running`, because that is the one thing that is genuinely different about it.
 *
 * ── The answer is the ROW, and it is the row for a reason ───────────────────
 *
 * Two written contracts disagreed here before either side built against them: a
 * `Settled` type that does not exist in this codebase, and a `{ok} | {ok,error}`
 * result reasonably derived from it. BOTH ARE WRONG THE SAME WAY — neither can
 * say CANCELLED. `JobState` (shared/types.ts) distinguishes `done`, `failed` and
 * `cancelled` deliberately: a cancel is somebody spending GPU and then taking it
 * back, not a failure, and filing one as a failure is how a host's retry restarts
 * work a person just stopped. The row already spells all three, plus the engine's
 * own words in `error` — and it is the very shape the host mints going in and
 * pushes back through `setHostQueueRows`, so there is ONE account of what happened
 * rather than two that can drift.
 *
 * IT RESOLVES RATHER THAN REJECTS, whatever the state. A failed run is not an
 * exception here: it is a fact about a row, reported the way this queue has always
 * reported it.

 *
 * ── WHICH READING, PROVEN RATHER THAN ASSUMED ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `recordReading` has just stamped the catalogue and left the pointer standing on
 * the row it landed — a read is not retained beside you (`RETAINED_BESIDE_YOU`),
 * and a replace swaps into the step it re-ran and stands there too — so
 * `bookAtPosition` reads back exactly the reading this job just made: its bank,
 * the language it was asked in, and the archived original the figures are cut
 * out of. That is one source for four facts that would otherwise be composed
 * here from a request and a filename.
 *
 * AND IT IS CHECKED, because `recordReading` NEVER THROWS. A catalogue it could
 * not write is a console line of its own and a bank that is still on disk — and
 * the position then still names the reading BEFORE this one, whose book file is
 * about a different pass over the pages. Remaking that would quietly re-cut
 * another reading's figures on the strength of this run finishing. So the two
 * answers are put side by side: the position must name a reading at all, and that
 * reading's bank must be the file this run filled. Anything else is a sentence in
 * the terminal and nothing touched — which is a refusal, not a fallback: there is
 * no second guess at which reading this is, and the reflow stays as it was until
 * somebody opens the book, which ensures it (`loadBook`).

 * THE BOOK FILE, REMADE BECAUSE THE READING LANDED — the one door the contract

 *
 * ── Why it overwrites, and why that is the safe direction ───────────────────
 *
 * A book file is a pure function of the receipt (docs/BOOK-FILE.md §1) and is
 * regenerated ONLY deliberately, never silently on open, because ops are keyed to
 * the ids in it. This is the deliberate moment: a NEW BANK has just landed at this
 * path, so a book file sitting beside it is the reflow of answers that no longer
 * exist — stale by definition, and the loader would refuse it by name on the next
 * open (`bankSha`, electron/book.ts). Rebuilding it here is what turns that
 * refusal into a book somebody can read, and the log line is the announcement §2
 * asks for.
 *
 * THE FIGURES COME WITH IT AND ARE NOT THIS SIDE'S BUSINESS. `--pdf` is passed
 * whenever the archive is one, and the engine sweeps `readings/<key>.images/` and
 * re-cuts only the pages that carry Picture blocks (src/vlm/book-run.ts). A
 * project whose original is an EPUB has no pages to cut and the engine says so —
 * an ordinary answer, not a hole.
 *
 * A REFUSAL IS THE ENGINE'S OWN WORDS TO THE TERMINAL AND NOTHING ELSE. The bank
 * is real, it is complete, and it is what those hours bought; reporting the
 * reading as a failure because the reflow after it would not run would be this
 * app calling somebody's GPU time lost over a file it can make again in seconds.
 * The next open of the book makes it (`loadBook`), which is the same command with
 * the same arguments.
