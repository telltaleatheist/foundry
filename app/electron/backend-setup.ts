/**
 * backend-setup — build the WSL environment vLLM is served from, out loud.
 *
 * This is the "dependency downloader" idea from BookForge's component-manager,
 * kept and stripped to its bones: a named target, a plan of commands, every
 * line of output forwarded to the screen while it runs, a cancel that actually
 * kills the tree, and a result that is either a path or a sentence.
 *
 * What is NOT kept from there: a catalog, versions, hashes, mirrors, an update
 * check. Nothing here is OURS to version. `pip install vllm` resolves whatever
 * CUDA wheels that distro's Python takes, and the model weights are pulled by
 * vLLM into the guest's own HuggingFace cache on first serve.
 *
 * ── Three rules ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **It talks the whole time.** A vLLM install is ~2 GB of torch and CUDA wheels
 * and several minutes on a good line. A spinner that says nothing for five
 * minutes is indistinguishable from a hang, and a user who cannot tell the
 * difference kills it — so every stdout and stderr line goes to the renderer as
 * it arrives (electron/wsl.ts `streamInDistro`).
 *
 * **It never falls back.** A user who picked conda and whose conda failed is
 * told that conda failed. Quietly building a venv instead would leave them with
 * an environment they did not ask for, in a place they will not look, the next
 * time they debug this.
 *
 * **It is idempotent.** An env that already exists is not recreated, and a vllm
 * that already imports is not reinstalled. Re-running after a network drop
 * resumes at the step that failed rather than starting two gigabytes again.
