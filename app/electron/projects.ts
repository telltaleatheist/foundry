/**
 * projects — one folder per book, in four layers.
 *
 * A conversion used to write `<libraryDir>/workspace/<slug>-<key>.epub`, the
 * readings bank lived a continent away in `<userData>/readings/<key>.jsonl`, and
 * nothing on disk tied a translation to the book it came from. You could not ask
 * "what has been made from this PDF?" because the answer was spread across two
 * directories and encoded only in a filename prefix.
 *
 * A PROJECT is the answer, and it is one directory:
 *
 *   <libraryDir>/projects/<slug>-<contentkey>/
 *     project.json            the catalogue — see ProjectManifest
 *     archive/                the imported originals. NEVER written.
 *     generated/              the model's cast EPUB, or the imported EPUB, or
 *                             the book reprinted as a real-text PDF. NEVER
 *                             written.
 *     working/                what the user edits: the unpacked EPUB tree, and
 *                             the live PDF.
 *     final/                  what Save and Export produce, named for the book.
 *     readings/<key>.jsonl    the bank of the model's per-page answers
 *     history/<tree>.json     the undo ledger of the working copy of that name,
 *                             bound to the generation that made it
 *
 * ── The rule the layout exists for ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * EVERY DOCUMENT HAS TWO LAYERS: an origin that is never written, and a live
 * copy that is what the user means by "the PDF" or "the EPUB". Saving writes the
 * live copy. The origin is what makes stepping back, or starting over, possible
 * at all — and for a scanned book the imported file may be the only copy of that
 * scan that will ever exist.
 *
 * `generated/` is the second origin and it is sacrosanct on its own argument: it
 * is the single record of what the model ACTUALLY READ, every curation decision
 * downstream is measured against it, and "start over" means throwing the working
 * tree away and unpacking it again from there.
 *
 * ── And the user never sees any of this ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ONE DOCUMENT PER KIND. `Working Towards The Fuhrer. Kershaw, Ian. (1993).pdf`
 * and the matching `.epub`, as one unit. No `.generated`, no `.archive`, no
 * suffixes, no layer names anywhere a person can read them: every file in a
 * project is named from `manifest.stem`, which is the imported document's own
 * name with its extension taken off. The SLUG is for the directory and nothing
 * else, and `final/` is named for the book like everything else.
 *
 * ── The key ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `<slug>-<8 hex of the import's sha256>`, unchanged from the flat workspace it
 * replaces, and the reason it is unchanged is worth the paragraph:
 *
 *   - the hash is of the document's CONTENT, not of its path, so the same book
 *     lands in the same project no matter where the user dragged it from — a
 *     second run REPLACES the first rather than accumulating `book (1).epub`;
 *   - the READINGS bank keeps that key, so an interrupted run of a book that has
 *     since been moved or renamed still resumes. That bank is GPU-hours; a key
 *     a rename could break would silently cost them;
 *   - and the flat files this migrates FROM already carry it, which is what
 *     makes adoption a regrouping rather than a re-hash of everything on disk.
 *
 * ── Nothing is deleted ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Re-running a conversion does not clobber the origin it replaces — it rotates
 * it into `generated/archived-<timestamp>/` (`rotateGenerated`), and the working
 * tree unpacked from it goes into the same folder so the next open unpacks the
 * NEW book rather than reopening the old one's edits.
 *
 * A GENERATED BOOK IS ARCHIVED AND A READINGS BANK IS NOT, and the difference is
 * deliberate rather than an inconsistency (docs/BANK-LIFECYCLE.md §5). A
 * generated EPUB can carry a working tree with a person's text edits in it, and
 * labour is kept forever. A bank is a machine's answers: the engine writes the
 * replacement beside the old one and renames it into place only when the run has
 * succeeded, so nothing is destroyed until its successor exists and `readings/`
 * grows no `archived-<stamp>/` hoards.
 *
 * ── Except when the user says so ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `deleteProject` is the single exception and the rule survives it intact, because
 * the rule was never "these bytes are sacred" — it is that THIS APP does not get
 * to decide a person's work is finished with. Every rotation above is Foundry
 * choosing, on its own, what to do with something it was not asked about; a
 * delete from Home is the user choosing, about their own folder, having been told
 * in words what is in it. Archiving instead would leave a directory they would
 * then have to go and delete by hand, which is not a kindness, it is a lie about
 * what the button did.

 * only fall one of two ways: files on disk that nothing names, or rows naming
 * files that are gone. The second is the survivable one — `summarise` already
 * draws a document whose file is missing, marked missing, so a person can see
 * what happened and act — while the first is a folder quietly holding hours of
 * GPU that no screen in this app will ever mention again. So the record of the
 * decision lands first, and the unlinking follows it.
 *
 * A FILE THAT WILL NOT DELETE IS A NAMED CONSOLE LINE AND NOT A THROW, for the
 * same reason: by the time it is reached the delete has happened as far as this
 * app's own bookkeeping is concerned, and rejecting the call would tell the user
 * their delete failed while leaving it done. What is left behind is one stray
 * file, named, in a folder they can open.
 *
 * WHAT IS DESTROYED IS `orphanedPayloads` AND NOT "the removed steps' payloads".
 * Two steps are allowed to name one file and in this app routinely do — see that
 * function for the re-read that leaves two `read` steps pointing at one bank.
 *
 * ── AND THE PER-TYPE ROW GOES IN THE SAME BREATH ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `manifest.documents` is the other record of the same files — the chains Home's
 * document rows are drawn from — and a delete that struck the ledger and left
 * those alone gave the user a row for a file it had just erased, drawn as
 * `missing`: the app's way of saying "something happened to a file you still
 * have" about the one thing they had deliberately thrown away. So `chainsWithout`
 * strikes them, from `orphanedPayloads` for the same reason the unlinking is —
 * what a surviving step still names is still on disk and is still a true row.
 *
 * IN THIS TRANSACTION, not a second one. Both edits are made against the open
 * manifest and land in ONE `writeManifest`, so there is no window where a crash
 * could leave the two records disagreeing about what this project has. The window
 * that does remain is the one below — rows written, files not yet unlinked — and
 * it falls the survivable way on purpose.
 *
 * ── AND THE PAYLOAD'S OWN BELONGINGS GO WITH IT ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * `planStepSweep` is the rest of the delete, and its comment is the argument: a
 * translation's EPUB has a working tree unpacked from it and an undo ledger named
 * after that tree, and a delete that took the row and the file and left those
 * behind left a directory of somebody's markup that nothing in the app can reach.
 * The tree's manifest row goes in the same transaction as the ledger surgery, for
 * the reason the chains do — a row naming a directory that is not there is the
 * exact state `rotateGenerated` is careful never to leave.
 *
 * ── AND A BANK'S HALF-FINISHED REPLACEMENT GOES WITH THE BANK ───────────────
 *
 * A re-read writes into `<bank>.pending` and swaps it over the real file only on
 * success, so a run that died leaves that pending file and its request sidecar
 * beside the bank as resumable debris (docs/BANK-LIFECYCLE.md §2). NO STEP NAMES

 * existing — so `orphanedPayloads` cannot find them and they would sit in
 * `readings/` forever after the bank they were replacing was deleted. Debris whose
 * bank is gone is debris about nothing. `orphanedBanks` decides which files are
 * banks, from the step's own action, and `planStepSweep` adds the pair.
 *
 * ── AND A TRANSLATION'S BANK IS THE SAME ARGUMENT ABOUT A DIFFERENT FILE ────
 *
 * A translate step's payload is the EPUB; the answers it was assembled from are in
 * the bank beside it, named by `params.bank` and by no step's payload anywhere. So
 * `orphanedPayloads` cannot find that either, and deleting the English translation
 * used to leave its whole per-block record in `readings/` — the same hours of GPU,
 * kept for a row that no longer exists. It is destroyed with the step, guarded by
 * the same whole-path check against what every surviving step MEANS by its bank
 * (recorded, or composed from its language for a translation that predates the
 * record), and its own pending file goes with it.
 *
 * A QUEUED JOB ABOUT TO RESUME ONE CANNOT LOSE IT TO THIS, and there is no new
 * mechanism for that: `refuseBusyStepDelete` (electron/main.ts) already refuses a
 * step delete while ANY held, queued or running job writes into this project —
 * deliberately coarse, on `refuseBusyJob`'s own argument that a narrower test
 * would have to predict where a run that has not started will write. Both IPC
 * doors ask it, the describe and the delete, so the card is never drawn for
 * something the click would refuse.

 *
 * `bookFileFor` above names the reading's reflow after the bank it is a pure
 * function of. This one is the same idea one transform along: when a translate
 * lands, main materialises `parent book file + chain ops + records` into a

 * `readings/<key>.hu.records.jsonl` becomes `readings/<key>.hu.book.jsonl`, and a
 * branch's `<key>.hu.<id8>.records.jsonl` becomes `<key>.hu.<id8>.book.jsonl`:
 * one translation, one book, no collision with the reading's own `<key>.book.jsonl`
 * because the language tag is always between them.
 *

 * translate step made before records kept its words inside an EPUB in

 * `.book.jsonl` to whatever it was handed would put a derived book beside a book,

 * that none of them is the lenient way in. This one only reads — but what it
 * reads is handed to a SPAWN of the engine with `--out` pointed at the answer
 * (electron/book.ts), and a path this process never agreed to is not a path
 * anything gets to write into.
 *
 * The manifest rides back with it because every caller needs it anyway — the
 * project's title is the only thing the book file itself cannot say.
 *
 * THE PDF AND THE LANGUAGE RIDE BACK TOO, because the reflow takes both
 * (`vlm-book --pdf --language`) and both are this module's facts: the archived
 * original is `archive/<manifest.archive.file>` — named only where the archive
 * IS a PDF, because the figure crops are cut out of pages and an archived EPUB
 * has none — and the language is what the reading in effect at the position
 * declared when it ran. Null for either is an ordinary answer the engine has a
 * documented behaviour for (no figures cut and says so; language defaults),
 * not a hole this side papers over.
 *
 * AND SO DOES THE READING ITSELF, which is one line here and stops a second
 * opinion elsewhere. Everything above is derived from that one step — the bank
 * is its payload and the language is its param — so a caller that needs the ROW
 * as well (the read landing, which names that reading's facsimile after it) must
 * not go and ask the ledger a second time for the step these answers came out
 * of. Two reads of one catalogue is two answers the moment anything lands in
 * between. Null is the honest answer for a project with no reading on the path,
 * and it is what makes `bank` above a composed fallback rather than a payload —
 * a caller that must be sure it is holding a real reading tests for it.
 *
 * `at` IS `readingBank`'s OWN PARAMETER, PASSED THROUGH, and it exists here for
 * its reason: a landing works on ONE STEP while the pointer is wherever the
 * person happens to be standing. A translation's derived book file is
 * materialised at the moment the run lands (docs/RENDERER.md §4), by which time
 * somebody may have clicked onto a branch under a different reading — and a book
 * built for that step out of this position's bank would be the other reading's
 * pages under that step's name. Null and absent both mean the position, which is
 * what every viewer asks.

 * promise, and the one that was never built.
 *
 * ── What clicking a row did, and what the user said about it ────────────────
 *
 * `positionView` already decided the block editor's MODE and which corrections
 * are drawn, and `b61bfab` wired both of those to a pointer move. What it never
 * touched was WHICH FILE was under them: `Tab.path` is fixed when a document is
 * opened from the documents panel and nothing else ever moved it. So a project
 * holding both `archive/<scan>.pdf` and the reprint made from its reading showed
 * exactly one of them however many rows the user clicked — *"switching between
 * steps doesnt switch between the original pdf and the rendered facsimile like i
 * expected"* — and when the app had nothing it could change it said so, which is
 * the other half of the same complaint: *"instead of showing the document, it gave
 * me an error saying it couldnt show the document… it should be showing me
 * document"*.
 *
 * ── Why the resolution is HERE and not in the renderer ──────────────────────
 *
 * Because composing a project path in the renderer is how a branch read ends up
 * answering for the original reading's file. It is the same rule that put
 * `readingBank` and `renderingOverlay` in this file rather than at their call
 * sites: the pointer decides which of several files a surface is handed, and a
 * second opinion composed from the project key is a lie the moment a project holds
 * two of anything. Main also has to ADMIT the path to the viewer's allow-list
 * (main.ts, `openable`), which the renderer cannot do for itself and must not be
 * able to.
 *
 * ── The four rows ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A ROW THAT RETAINED A DOCUMENT SHOWS IT (`PositionView.own`): the import shows
 * the untouched original, a translation shows the book in the other language.
 * Nothing is walked and nothing is composed — the step's own payload, resolved
 * against the project directory.
 *
 * A READ OR A SAVE SHOWS THE BOOK CAST FROM THAT READING — the flowing document,
 * which is `generated/<stem>.epub`. That is a rendering rather than a payload
 * (renderings are deliberately not steps — STEP-LEDGER.md "Decided" #4), so it is
 * answered by asking the project what it holds.
 *
 * ── This is the seam moving, exactly where it was said it would ─────────────
 *
 * It used to answer the live PDF — `working/<stem>.pdf` — and that was the honest
 * answer while the PDF was the only surface anything could edit. It stopped being
 * honest the moment a reading landed with a book beside it: the user clicked the
 * OCR row expecting the thing the reading MADE and got the photograph it was made
 * from. Their own words for the whole shape of it: "from that bank, we create an
 * html page of the document - a proto epub. that's the step that appears
 * automatically the moment i OCR something. i can now either click back to step 1,
 * which shows the original pdf, or i can click the ocr step, which shows the PDF
 * in html/epub form."
 *
 * The proto-epub is not a new artefact this had to wait for. It is
 * `vlm-convert --format epub` over the bank — deterministic, every block stamped,
 * already the thing select mode strikes and relabels — and the queue now casts one
 * the instant a reading lands (electron/job-queue.ts). This function is where that
 * cast becomes what a row SHOWS. The PDF keeps the import row and nothing else:
 * facsimile and stop (docs/DERIVED-BOOK.md §1).
 *
 * ── `generated/` and not a working copy, which is the opposite of the old rule ─
 *
 * A PDF has a live copy in `working/` and an EPUB does not: a book's working copy
 * is the TREE unpacked from its origin, made on open by the epub reader, and the
 * file a pane is pointed at is the origin the tree comes from
 * (`liveCopyOf` already says this for the import row). So aiming at `generated/`
 * here is aiming at the same layer every EPUB in this app is opened from, not at a
 * layer nothing edits — and there is no second document with the same basename to
 * collide with, because the book and the scan differ by extension.
 *
 * ── Two limitations, named rather than engineered around ────────────────────
 *
 * NOTHING RECORDS WHICH READING A CAST WAS MADE FROM. Renderings are not steps and
 * are not going to become steps, so a project with two `read` rows (a re-read
 * asking for a different page range branches — `MINTED_BY_THE_RUN`) has one cast
 * book and two rows that would both claim it. Both get it — the newest cast, which
 * is the one the newest reading left. That is wrong for at most one of them, and
 * the alternative is provenance bookkeeping for a file phase B replaces
 * (docs/DERIVED-BOOK.md §6).
 *
 * AND A CURATE ROW SHOWS ITS OWN CAST, WHICH IS THE DEFERRAL ABOVE, BUILT. It
 * used to show the project's ONE cast — so every save in a book's history showed
 * the same document, the live tree wearing today's marks, and clicking an old save
 * showed you the present. A curate landing now casts its own book
 * (`curateCastFile`, shared/ledger.ts; the job is fired at the commit in main.ts)
 * and this is where that book becomes what the row shows.
 *
 * THE FALLBACK TO `castBook` IS NOT A LEGACY BRANCH. Every project curated before
 * this unit has saves with no cast of their own, and they go on showing the
 * project's cast exactly as they did — which is the honest answer for them, since
 * nothing else about that save was ever recorded. So does a save whose cast has
 * not landed yet: the job takes seconds, and a pane that showed nothing while it
 * ran would be worse than one showing the book it is about to replace.
 *
 * ── The fallback is the old answer, and it is not a legacy branch ───────────
 *
 * The cast is a queued job: it is planned the moment the reading lands and it
 * takes seconds, but there is a window where the row exists and the book does not,
 * and there are projects on disk read before anything cast automatically. Both get
 * the live PDF, which is what this function has always answered — the pages are
 * the same pages, and a pane showing the scan is the app doing its job while the
 * book is on its way.
 *
 * ── Null is an ordinary answer ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A project with no reading yet, a row whose payload has been swept off the disk,
 * an EPUB-only project standing where a scan would be: all of them mean "this
 * position names no document of its own", and the panes correctly keep the one
 * they have rather than being sent somewhere. Proved to exist before it is
 * returned, because a path handed to a viewer for a file that is not there is a
 * blank pane with nothing on screen saying why.

/**
 * STAND WHERE THIS DOCUMENT BELONGS — `documentAtPosition` run backwards, and the

 *
 * ── The two selectors pretending to be one ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The library picked a FILE and the steps list picked a STEP, and the user found
 * the hole between them: *"i could have a document open, the epub, but have the
 * pdf import step selected, and id never know that i just ran translate against
 * the original pdf rather than the generated epub because i had the wrong step
 * selected, since the right document was open."* Every action in this app is made
 * from the POSITION — a reading's parent, a translation's source, what Export is
 * offered — so a pane showing one thing while the pointer stands on another is an
 * app that will quietly act on the file the person is not looking at. There is one
 * selection now, and focusing a document is one of the gestures that moves it.
 *
 * ── Why the mapping is HERE, beside the forward direction ───────────────────
 *
 * Because these are one fact read in two directions, and the day they disagree is
 * the day clicking a tab moves the pointer somewhere that then shows a different
 * file — a selection that fights the user. `documentAtPosition` is directly above;
 * everything this consults (`castBook`, `liveCopyOf`, the origin's payload) is
 * what that function consults, so a change to what a row SHOWS lands in the same
 * screen as what a document STANDS FOR.
 *
 * ── The four answers ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * AN EXPORT MOVES NOTHING. `final/` is where Save and Export write, and an export
 * is terminal by ruling — nothing is ever made from one (docs/WORKBENCH.md §1,
 * "it wont go into the working files as a step because it isnt the base for new
 * steps"). It has no step, so there is nowhere to stand, and yanking the pointer
 * to some plausible row because somebody glanced at a facsimile would be the app
 * inventing a selection out of a look.
 *
 * THE ORIGINAL STANDS ON THE IMPORT — its archived payload and the working copy
 * made from it, which are the two paths `documentAtPosition` answers for that row
 * and therefore the two that must come back to it. The live copy is asked for by
 * `liveCopyOf` rather than composed from `working/` and the stem: a working PDF
 * that came from somewhere else is a reprint that replaced the scan, and calling
 * that the import would stand the pointer on the untouched original for a document
 * the original is not.
 *
 * THE BOOK STANDS ON THE NEWEST STEP OF ITS CHAIN, and the newest is the point.
 * The cast in `generated/` is shown by the reading AND by every curate save under
 * it — one file, many rows — so the reverse direction has to choose, and the only
 * honest choice is the one you can act from: standing on an old save and then
 * translating would translate the book as of that save, which is not the book on
 * screen. (`castBook` records which cast is live; nothing records which READING
 * cast it, and `documentAtPosition` names that limitation rather than engineering
 * around it. The newest reading is the one that left it, so that is the chain
 * walked here — the same answer, from the same missing fact.)
 *
 * A TRANSLATION IS A BOOK OF ITS OWN and walks its own chain, from the translate
 * step that retained it down through its saves. That is why the walk stops at any
 * descendant that is a book of its own (`A_BOOK_OF_ITS_OWN`): a translation made
 * from a reading is emphatically not the newest step "of" that reading for the
 * purpose of deciding where the reading's own book stands.
 *
 * AND ANYTHING ELSE MOVES NOTHING. A loose file, a bank, a curation snapshot, a
 * rotated predecessor still on disk, a document from another project: none of them
 * is a row in this ledger, and the caller's tab is none the worse for the pointer
 * staying where the user put it. A READING'S FACSIMILE IS IN THAT LIST BY
 * DESIGN, and it is the one member of it that has a row in the left nav: it is
 * terminal, exactly as an export is (docs/RENDERER.md §0 A3), so looking at the
 * page-for-page record must not move the pointer onto the reading and make the
 * next thing somebody does be made from a glance.
 *
 * ── Standing still is not a write ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This runs on every focus gesture — a tab click, a Ctrl+Tab, a pane pointerdown —
 * where the answer is nearly always the row the pointer is already on. A manifest
 * rewritten on each of those would be a folder people sync churning for a fact
 * that did not change, so the write is skipped when nothing moves, and the answer
 * is composed from the catalogue as it already stands. `positionOf` and not
 * `ledger.position` for the comparison: an absent pointer MEANS the newest step
 * (shared/types.ts, `ProjectLedger.position`), so a project that has never written
 * one and is standing on its newest row must recognise itself and stay quiet.
 *
 * Where it does move it is `goToStep` and nothing else — the same write, the same
 * announcement, the same rows — because two ways to move the pointer is two
 * accounts of what moving it costs.

 *
 * ── What "the cast" is, among four things that share a chain ────────────────
 *
 * The EPUB's chain can hold four kinds of row and only one of them is the book the
 * reading made. A `translate` step is the book in another language. An `origin`
 * marked `irreplaceable` is a book the USER imported, which no reading produced
 * and which a read row must never claim. And a rotated predecessor is still in the

 * it is on disk, and it is not what a person standing on the reading means.
 *
 * So the test is all three of those said out loud: an `origin` row, not
 * irreplaceable, and sitting DIRECTLY in `generated/` rather than in an archive
 * folder under it. The last clause is the house rule doing real work — a rotated
 * cast's payload is `generated/archived-<stamp>/<name>.epub`, which starts with
 * `generated/` and is emphatically not the live one, so the segment count is
 * checked rather than the prefix alone.
 *
 * NEWEST WINS where a chain somehow holds two, by `appliedAt` and not by array
 * order: `recordStep` appends, which makes the array chronological in every
 * ordinary life of a project, and `summarise` sorts the same way for the same
 * reason — a chain read out of a catalogue somebody edited or a migration composed

 * reading the one that already exists, or a new one beside it?" has to be
 * answered here, at the plan, and answered the SAME WAY the landing will answer
 * it or the file and the row will describe different readings.
 *
 * It is the same question, asked of the same function, with the same three
 * arguments the landing uses:
 *
 *   THE ACTION is `read`, obviously.
 *
 *   THE PARENT IS THE ORIGIN, never the position. A reading reads the PIXELS,
 *   which live in `archive/` however far through their own history the person
 *   pressing OCR happens to be standing — the reading-parents-at-origin rule, and
 *   `recordReading` obeys it too (see `originOf` in shared/ledger.ts for what
 *   parenting it at the position would cost).
 *
 *   THE PARAMS ARE WHAT THE DIALOG ASKED, normalised by `askedOf` rather than
 *   trimmed here, precisely so the two askings cannot come to disagree about
 *   whether a blank box is a page range.
 *
 * ── The three answers ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A REPLACE aims at the target step's existing payload. Same step, same path, new
 * contents — which is what `recordLanding` already says about the row, now true
 * of the file as well. The engine writes a pending bank beside it and swaps on
 * success (docs/BANK-LIFECYCLE.md §2), so the old answers survive a failed run.
 *
 * A FIRST READING keeps `readings/<key>.jsonl`. That is what every project on
 * every disk already has, and the whole reason this scheme needs no migration.
 *
 * A BRANCH mints `readings/<key>.<id8>.jsonl`, `id8` being the front of the
 * step's own uuid. Deterministic, collision-free, and never shown to a person —
 * filenames are out of the UI, the row's name comes from `labelFor`. An ordinal
 * would read better in Explorer and would be a second counter to keep consistent
 * with the ledger; the uuid is already minted and already unique.
 *
 * THE ID IS MINTED HERE AND ONLY HERE, and travels on the request to the landing
 * (`ReadRequest.stepId`). Minting it at the landing instead would mean composing
 * a filename from an id the filename could not know; minting it twice would mean
 * a bank named after a step nobody created.

 * proving no surviving row names it; a branch that lands on an existing row's paths

 * records translation writes `readings/<key>.<tag>[.<id8>].records.jsonl` and no
 * document at all; the book comes later, cast from this file, as a rendering that
 * is nobody's payload (`castForTranslateStep`).
 *
 * So this is `recordReading`'s shape rather than `recordGenerated`'s, which is the
 * right family for a much better reason than convenience: both actions run a model
 * over a whole book, both leave a `.jsonl` of per-position answers in `readings/`,
 * and for both of them the payload IS that file. A read step's bank has been its
 * payload since docs/BANK-LIFECYCLE.md §4.1; this is the same sentence about the
 * other model pass, and it means `orphanedPayloads` protects and destroys a
 * translation's answers by a rule nobody had to teach it.
 *
 * ── The two facts the job hands over, and why neither is read off the disk ──
 *
 * THE LANGUAGE, because the alternative is reading a fact out of a filename. It
 * decides whether the next translation from this step replaces this row or
 * branches beside it (`MINTED_BY_THE_RUN` keeps every other param out of that
 * comparison), it is what a cast is declared as, and it is what the row says.
 *
 * THE SOURCE LANGUAGE, WHEN THIS RUN WAS A CHAIN. `params.from` is written by
 * nothing else, and it exists so a row in a two-hop chain can say both ends —
 * "Translated (en → hu)" — where the target alone would leave two rows looking
 * alike and the interesting fact legible only by walking parents.
 *
 * ── And the bank a replaced row used to name ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Re-translating a row that predates records swaps its payload from an EPUB in
 * `generated/` to a records file in `readings/`. `Landing.displaced` destroys the
 * book — it is a payload, no surviving row names it — and the BANK beside it is
 * not a payload at all, so nothing else in this app would ever mention it again.
 * It goes here, guarded the way the ledger guards a payload: by the whole
 * project-relative path, against what every surviving step MEANS by its bank.
 *
 * A failure is a console line and never a throw, exactly as `recordReading`'s is.
 * This runs after a run that may have taken hours; a catalogue row that could not
 * be written is not a reason to report those hours as a failure, and the records
 * are on disk either way.

 * Put a finished origin in the catalogue, and refresh the live copy it feeds.

 * catalogue for a file that does not exist, and Home would offer it.
 *
 * A PDF-PRODUCING CONVERSION REPLACES THE LIVE PDF. There is ONE PDF per
 * project — "the PDF", the working document — and applying a change to it
 * produces a new version of it rather than a second document beside it.
 *
 * ── This was got wrong once, and the reasoning is worth keeping ─────────────
 *
 * When the reprint stopped being the scan-with-a-layer and became type on blank
 * paper, this promotion was removed and the reprint was given a row of its own.
 * The fear was real: promoting it would file the user's SCAN into
 * `working/archived-<stamp>/` and hand them a text-only document under the name
 * of the photograph they imported. Nobody asked for their scan to be replaced.
 *
 * That was the right worry solved in the wrong place. The scan is protected by
 * `archive/` BEING IMMUTABLE — it is copied in once at import and no path in
 * this app is ever composed into it — not by making the user keep track of two
 * PDFs with the same filename. Solving it here cost exactly what a wrong
 * abstraction costs: two identical rows in the document list, two identical
 * options in the OCR picker, and a refusal that told somebody to go and convert
 * "the original instead" — an instruction about this app's filing, given to the
 * person the filing is supposed to be invisible to.
 *
 * So the promotion is back and the user sees one PDF. The one they see is the
 * working copy, it carries whatever has been applied to it, the previous version
 * is rotated aside rather than lost, and the original they imported is still on
 * disk untouched — reachable by exporting it or reverting to it, which are
 * deliberate gestures rather than a row in a list.
 *
 * A failure here is LOGGED and not thrown. This runs at the end of a run that
 * may have taken three hours, and losing a row in a catalogue is not a reason to
 * report the conversion itself as failed — but it is named, in full, so the line
 * says which file went unrecorded and why.

 * The live PDF the catalogue names — or the one on disk that it forgot.
 *
 * ── Why a listing reconciles instead of trusting itself ─────────────────────
 *
 * A project on this machine came up with `working.files: []` and a perfectly
 * good `working/<book>.pdf` sitting beside it, because a bug in the document
 * delete struck the row out without removing the file (see `deleteDocument`).
 * Under the step model the PDF row is built FROM that entry, so the catalogue's
 * answer to "what does this project have" was: nothing. A user whose book had
 * vanished from an app that was still storing every byte of it.
 *
 * The bug is fixed. This exists because fixing a bug does not repair the data it
 * already wrote, and because it is not the only way to reach that state — a
 * crash between the manifest write and the file copy, a file restored by hand
 * from a backup, and a folder synced from another machine all land there too.
 *
 * SO THE DISK IS THE AUTHORITY ABOUT WHAT EXISTS and the catalogue is the
 * authority about what it MEANS. A working copy present with no row is adopted
 * with the only provenance that can be inferred — the archive, which is where an
 * unrecorded working PDF must have come from — and the repair is logged, because
 * an app that silently papers over a hole in its own bookkeeping is an app whose
 * bookkeeping nobody can ever trust again.
 *
 * ── Why here, and why it does not write ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * IN `summarise`, not in the migration: the migration only ever runs on a v1
 * catalogue, and this hole is reachable at any version. Not in a repair pass
 * either, because a repair pass is a thing somebody has to remember to run, and
 * the failure it prevents is a book that is invisible RIGHT NOW.
 *
 * It returns the row rather than writing it, so a listing stays a read. The
 * repair is re-derived on every list — which costs one `exists` — and reaches
 * disk the next time anything edits the project for a reason of its own. A read
 * path that rewrote every catalogue it inspected would make opening Home a
 * write across the whole library.

/**
 * Prove `dir` is a project directory, and hand it back resolved. Or refuse.
 *
 * THIS IS A SECURITY BOUNDARY, not a tidiness check, and it is worth being blunt
 * about why. `deleteProject` calls `fsp.rm(dir, { recursive: true })`. The `dir`
 * it is given came across IPC from the renderer — a page that runs a book's own
 * markup in an iframe and an OpenAI-compatible endpoint's answers through a
 * parser. Every other door in this app that touches a path the renderer named
 * asks main's own allow-list first (`admitted`, in main.ts) precisely because a
 * renderer's word is not an authorization. This function is the whole of that
 * gate for the one call that erases directories, so if it is wrong, an argument
 * of `C:\Users\tellt` is a recursive delete of a home folder.
 *
 * A DIRECT CHILD, not a descendant. `projectDirOf` above answers "which project
 * is this path in", which is the right question for reading and the wrong one
 * here: it maps `…/projects/<key>/working/<tree>/EPUB` to the project, and a
 * containment test built on it would happily accept a path that is not a project
 * at all. What may be deleted is exactly the thing Home lists — one segment
 * under `projectsDir()` — so the test is that `path.relative` from the root
 * yields exactly ONE segment. That rejects the root itself (empty), anything
 * above it (`..`), anything on another drive (`path.relative` returns an absolute
 * path across Windows volumes), and every path deeper than a project.
 *
 * `path.resolve` first, so `.` and `..` inside the argument are spent before the
 * comparison rather than after it — a string test against an unresolved path is
 * the classic way this check gets defeated.
 *
 * NO EXCEPTIONS. If something ever needs to erase a directory that is not a
 * project, it does not get to reach it through here.
 *
 * THE STEP-LEDGER CALLS ASK IT TOO, and that is the check being used for exactly
 * what it is rather than being widened. `deleteStep` unlinks payload files inside
 * a directory the renderer named, which is the same authorization problem one
 * level down, and its describe/read/go siblings ask the same question so that no
 * member of that family is the lenient way in — a gate that only guards the
 * destructive call is a gate somebody routes around by reading first.

 * `generated/archived-<stamp>/<file>` before a rerun writes, so those are
 * previous versions of THE VERY FILE being deleted — five of them in the
 * Kershaw project from one evening's reruns. Matched by basename inside the
 * file's own parent directory, which is exact rather than approximate: an output
 * name is derived from the project's stem and its format (`generatedFileFor`),
 * so at most one live document can carry a given basename, and every archived
 * copy of that name is a former life of it.
 *
 * AND THAT IS THE WHOLE LIST NOW. Two other things used to be in it and both went
 * with the surfaces that made them (docs/RENDERER.md §7): the unpacked working
 * TREE a rotation parked beside the file, and `history/<tree>.json`, the block
 * editor's undo ledger keyed to that tree. Nothing writes either any more; a
 * project that still holds one keeps it, because sweeping somebody's records to
 * tidy a folder is not a thing this app does.
 *
 * ── What is NOT in here, and these are decisions ────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE READINGS BANK, above all — and it is the COST RULE in its purest form
 * (`ProjectStep.retention`). `readings/` is the stored result of the expensive
 * pass: it belongs to the source book rather than to any output made from it,
 * it is hours of GPU, it cannot be remade from anything else on the disk, and it
 * is the entire reason a conversion can be run again for nothing. Deleting the
 * EPUB must never cost the bank — the whole point of throwing an output away is
 * usually to make a better one from the same readings. (Deleting the book's own
 * row is a different act: that is a project delete, it takes the bank with
 * everything else, and it says so in those words.)
 *
 * THE FILED COPY. `final/` is where the user themself put a copy on purpose
 * (`recordFinal`), which makes it theirs rather than the workspace's. A delete
 * of the working document that also went and destroyed the copy somebody
 * deliberately filed would be reaching outside what was asked for — the same
 * reason a Save As to a USB stick is left alone.
 *
 * THE OPS AND THE FROZEN CURATIONS (`ops/`, `curations/`), and this is the bank's
 * rule carried one step further. A decision about the book is not about the EPUB —
 * it is about the READING, keyed by block id rather than by any output: the two
 * hundred running heads somebody struck are struck for every future rendering as
 * much as for the one being deleted. And deleting an output in order to make a
 * better one is the ordinary reason to delete an output, which is exactly the case
 * where destroying the decisions would be worst. By the retention rule they are
 * `irreplaceable` where the bank is merely `expensive`; a project delete takes
 * them, says so in those words, and nothing else does.

/**
 * Copy each flat bank into its project, then SET THE ORIGINAL ASIDE.
 *
 * ── The bug the set-aside fixes, because it had teeth ────────────────────────
 *
 * This used to copy and leave the original exactly where it was, and call itself
 * idempotent on the strength of `copyNewOnly` refusing an existing destination.
 * It was idempotent about the COPY and about nothing else: the file stayed in
 * the directory this scans, so every launch found it again, and finding it again
 * means `withCreatedProject` — which MAKES the project directory if it is not
 * there. Nothing further was copied and nothing was said, so the loop was
 * invisible.
 *
 * Then Home got a delete button, and the loop stopped being invisible: a project
 * the user deleted came back on the next launch as an empty shell — a
 * `project.json` naming a book, a `readings/` folder, and no documents at all.
 * Measured on Owen's machine, an hour after a delete. A delete that undoes
 * itself at the next launch is not a delete, and the user has no way to tell
 * which of the two things they are looking at.
 *
 * So the original MOVES into `adopted/` once its copy is in place. The bytes are
 * still there — this function still refuses to be the thing that destroys a
 * bank — but the scan no longer sees them, and adoption becomes idempotent IN
 * FACT rather than in intention. `adoptLegacyGenerated` never had this problem
 * because it moves what it adopts.
 *
 * IF THE SET-ASIDE CANNOT HAPPEN, SAY SO BY NAME. A bank that could not be moved
 * is one this will find again next launch, so the sentence in the log is the
 * only warning that the shell is going to come back — and it names the file, the
 * place it was going, and why. A destination in `adopted/` that already exists
 * stops this BEFORE the project is created, which is the one case that can be
 * headed off entirely: two flat files of one name cannot both be set aside, and
 * creating a directory for the second would recreate the very shell this is
 * meant to stop.
