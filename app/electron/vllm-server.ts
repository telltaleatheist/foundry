/**
 * vllm-server — the reading server, served from WSL, for as long as the queue
 * wants it.
 *
 * Adapted from BookForge's electron/vlm-page-server.ts, which is the proven
 * version of this. What was taken, and why each piece is load-bearing:
 *
 *   · **The serve command's shape.** `conda run -n <env> --no-capture-output
 *     vllm serve <model> --trust-remote-code --host 0.0.0.0 --port <p>
 *     --gpu-memory-utilization <u> --max-model-len 32768`, through
 *     `wsl.exe -d <distro> -e bash -lc`. `--trust-remote-code` is not optional:
 *     dots.ocr ships its own modeling code and vLLM refuses the repo without it,
 *     by name, in a pydantic ValidationError. `--no-capture-output` is what puts
 *     the guest's log on THIS process's handles while it runs, which is what the
 *     readiness wait below reads.
 *
 *   · **Readiness from the server's own log, not just the clock.** Polling
 *     /v1/models alone turns every failure into the full timeout. A CUDA OOM, a
 *     missing module or a rejected config says so in the first thirty seconds
 *     and then sits there; scanning for those patterns fails the job in thirty
 *     seconds with the log tail as the message.
 *
 *   · **One in-flight start promise.** Two jobs beginning together must share
 *     one spawn, or the second reserves VRAM the first already holds.
 *
 *   · **Stopping from INSIDE the distro.** `pkill -TERM` in the guest, not a
 *     taskkill on wsl.exe: SIGKILLing a process that holds the CUDA device is
 *     the documented way to wedge WSL until a reboot. The Windows-side tree kill
 *     is a last resort, after the graceful stop has been given its minute.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately NOT taken ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * BookForge reference-counts the server and tears it down the moment the last
 * conversion lets go, because it arbitrates one GPU between vLLM and TTS. This
 * app has no other GPU tenant and a serial queue that usually has more books
 * behind the one running, so paying ~44 s of model load between every pair of
 * them would be a tax on nothing. The server stays up until the app quits or
 * the user stops it.
 *
 * ── The one rule about somebody else's server ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * If port 8000 already answers, that server is USED and never owned: not
 * stopped on quit, not stopped by the Stop button, not restarted. It may be the
 * user's own hand-started vLLM, and killing a thing this app did not start is
 * how you lose someone else's work.

 * and nothing to ask, so the number is a cap rather than a measurement. Half is
 * clear of the ~6 GB of weights plus a workable KV cache on any card big enough
 * to run this at all, and leaves the desktop its half — and under WSL's dxg
