/**
 * THE LIGHT TABLE'S STATE — the recipe, and every rule about changing it.
 *
 * ── Where the line falls between this and the components ────────────────────
 *
 * The grid owns an arrangement and the editor owns four corners; NEITHER owns
 * the recipe, and neither can reach IPC. Everything they emit arrives here as a
 * question about the whole project — which photographs are the same shape as
 * this one, which pages belong to which photo, what the order means once
 * somebody has dragged — because those are the questions a single card cannot
 * answer about itself.
 *
 * That is also what lets the two components be pointed at anything: the doc's
 * trap about reversing spreads rather than page cards (below) is a rule about
 * photos, and only this service holds photos.
 *
 * ── PICTURES REACH THE PAGE THROUGH THE DOOR, NEVER THROUGH IPC ─────────────
 *
 * `foundry-file://capture/<token>/<name>`, where the token comes back from
 * `create`, `intake` or `recipeLoad` and the names are `photo.thumb` and
 * `photo.workingCopy` — PLAIN BASENAMES out of `capture/derived/`, which is the
 * only directory the capture token reaches. Nothing here composes a path: the
 * names are written by intake and carried in the recipe, so the layout on disk
 * is main's business alone.
 *
 * THE BANK HAS NO DOOR. `capture/originals/` — the HEIC files that are somebody's
 * only copy of an afternoon in an archive — is not merely unserved but
 * UNADDRESSABLE through the scheme, because no string this service could compose
 * reaches out of `derived/`. That is a property of the flat-name rule rather than
 * a check anybody has to keep right (feature channel, seq 40).
 *
 * ── The recipe is saved WHOLE, and debounced ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `capture:recipe-save` takes the entire document every time — it is kilobytes
 * for hundreds of photographs, and a patch protocol would be a second way to say
 * what the file already says. Dragging a corner emits on every pointermove, so
 * the writes are debounced here rather than in the editor: the editor should not
 * have to know that saving costs anything.

   * Shown on the invoke it cannot fail to appear, whatever the other end does;
   * cleared in the finally it cannot outlive the work. The pushes only decorate
   * a card that was already going to be there.
   *
   * (An earlier version of this paragraph justified the same decision by saying
   * the first push does not arrive until a photograph is decoded, "over a second
   * on this shoot". P1 measured it at 110 ms — the emit is BEFORE the work, not
   * after it, which is the same decision that makes the payload name the

   * this project keeps refusing, so the claim is gone rather than softened.)

   * The obvious derivation — sort the ids and compare the two arrays — breaks on

   * neither, and the toggle would disable itself permanently on a shoot whose
   * only fault was being copied in one go.
   *
   * So this asks the question that survives ties: does the sequence of times
   * ever move against itself? If it never does, in either direction, the sort
   * still applies and nobody has arranged anything.
   *
   * The one imprecision left is worth naming and is harmless: a drag that moves a

   *
   * It copied one photograph's whole configuration onto every other photograph
   * of the same shape, from a button in the modal. That press is now
   * `recordCrop` — which sets the book's standing and touches nobody else — and
   * the table's `applyCrops`, which lands the standing on every photograph that
   * is not complete. The split is THE SCOPE RULE: a control in the modal speaks
   * for the photograph it has open, and a press there that changed twenty-four
   * other pictures was the modal speaking for the book.
   *
   * Everything the stamp arm knew survives in those two: `standingOf` lifts the
   * configuration, `wearing` puts it on, `isComplete` decides who is skipped and
   * `announce` says what happened. Nothing was deleted except the SURFACE the
   * act was reached from.
   *
   * ── THE TURN IS NOT SUPERSEDED, and it is a different act in two ways ────
   *
   * It applies across photographs of DIFFERENT shapes, where a crop cannot — so
   * folding it into the book's crop would make "all" mean two different sets in
   * one sentence. And it overwrites nobody's corners: `turnedLike` relabels
   * which corner prints top-left, so every crop on every photograph survives a
   * bulk turn to the last decimal.
   *
   * SHAPE STILL DECIDES WHO IS ASKED, though, because "match this one" is a
   * question about the same rectangle seen the same way round: the acceptance
   * shoot has twenty-six portrait photographs and one landscape, and the odd one
   * is NAMED rather than silently left out. `sameShape` (shared/capture.ts) is
   * the 2% test.
   *
   * IT SKIPS NOBODY FOR BEING COMPLETE, deliberately. Complete means the book
   * has stopped moving this photograph's CROP; the way round a page sits is a
   * fact the person set by turning it, and a bulk turn that spared complete
   * photographs would leave exactly the pages somebody had already worked on

 * ONE PHOTOGRAPH, TURNED — AND ITS SPLIT RE-SEATED WITH IT.
 *
 * ── A turn does not move a corner, but it does move a PAGE ─────────────────
 *
 * `turnQuad` permutes the corner assignment without moving any point, so the
 * crop stays on exactly the same part of the photograph however many times it
 * is turned. That is why turning each page's quad on its own LOOKS right.
 *
 * It is not right for a spread, and the measurement says so exactly. Turning
 * the two halves of a centre-split independently, against re-deriving them
 * from the turned sheet:
 *
 *   a quarter turn      the same, both ways
 *   a half turn         THE HALVES SWAP READING ORDER
 *   three quarters      THE HALVES SWAP READING ORDER
 *
 * Which is obvious once seen: turn a spread upside down and the page that was
 * on the left is on the right. The independent turn keeps the old order, so
 * the book silently gets two pages in the wrong sequence -- and it is
 * invisible on the table, because both cards are there and both look correct.
 *
 * So a photograph with a cut in it is turned by rebuilding the WHOLE sheet,
 * turning that, and asking `halvesOf` for the halves again. The split itself
 * is untouched: it is a segment in the photograph's own fraction space and a
 * turn moves nothing, so the cut is still across the same gutter.
 *
 * ── WHAT FOLLOWS A HALF, AND WHAT FOLLOWS AN INDEX ────────────────────────
 *
 * A strike is a decision about a PHYSICAL page -- "this one is a duplicate" --
 * so when the order swaps, the strike has to travel with the half rather than
 * stay on the seat. Each re-derived half is matched back to the turned quad it
 * equals, and carries that page's strike with it. Matching by GEOMETRY rather
 * than by a swap rule means this stays right if `halvesOf` ever orders a turn
 * differently than it does today.

 * over the pages is the release.
 *
 * The reverse case is handled at the WRITE and not here (see `placed`): a

 * The stamp dresses every same-shaped photograph in it, and *Match the others*
 * dresses one. Written twice, "what it means to take the book's crop" would have
 * two answers on the day it was defined -- which is the defect `outputSizeFor`,
 * `sameShape` and `splitFromFraction` were each moved into `shared/` to prevent,
 * and each of those had two bodies within hours.
 *
 * ── IT KEEPS THE TURN AND COPIES THE CROP, which is Owen's ruling ─────────
 *
 * `turnedLike` moves no corner: it relabels which corner prints top-left, taking
 * that label from the photograph being dressed. So a page somebody turned
 * upright stays upright while receiving the book's crop exactly, to the last
 * decimal, because there is no arithmetic here to be wrong by a pixel.
 *
 * ── AND IT CUTS THE SHEET RATHER THAN CARRYING TWO HALVES ────────────────
 *
 * Which is what makes it right for a spread facing the other way. Turn a spread
 * upside down and the page that was on the left is on the right; halves carried
 * across keep their old order and the book silently gets two pages in the wrong
 * sequence. Re-deriving them from the turned sheet re-orders them into reading
 * order for free, because the corner order IS the orientation.
 *
 * ── What null means ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No crop in the standing -- nothing to wear -- or a cut that resolves against
 * this sheet to neighbouring edges, which cuts a corner off and is a shape the
 * mint cannot print. Both are answered by leaving the photograph alone, because
 * the alternative is inventing a page.
 *
 * STRIKES BELONG TO THE PHOTOGRAPH, NOT TO THE CONFIGURATION, so they stay on
 * the seat they were on. A page struck for being a blurred retake is still a
 * blurred retake after somebody changes its crop.
