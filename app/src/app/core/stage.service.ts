/**
 * WHAT IS ON SCREEN — one document, or Home.
 *
 * ── The service the single-viewer ruling made possible ──────────────────────
 *
 * There was nothing to put here while the workspace was one to five COLUMNS,
 * because "what is on screen" was not a fact: it was a list of columns, a focused
 * one among them, a strip of tabs inside each, and a pinned flag deciding which
 * of them a click was allowed to displace. "The document" meant "the focused
 * column's top tab", which is a fact about FURNITURE, and every action in the app
 * keyed off it. The user ended that (2026-08-17):
 *
 *   *"i dont think we should have tabs in foundry. i think its making things a
 *   bit confusing. however, the user should be able to compare two steps
 *   sometimes. so i think the solution is to have a single viewer window/single
 *   tab, and if the user wants to compare two steps, theres a compare button
 *   they can click and then they can choose the step to compare."*
 *
 * With one viewer the question has one answer, and this class is that answer plus
 * the three gestures that move it: Home, Ctrl+Tab, and putting a document in
 * front of somebody. Compare (docs/PLAN.md §4, unit 8d) landed here too — a
 * second, read-only stage beside the live one — which is the other reason this is
 * a service and not two computeds on the documents list.
 *
 * THAT SECOND STAGE IS A UNION NOW, and it is worth saying at the top because it
 * is the one piece of state on this class that two features share. The analysis
 * hits panel takes the same slot (docs/ANALYSIS.md §8, Owen: *"a list of hits in
 * blocks on the right side, where compare would normally be"*), so `secondColumn`
 * holds one or the other and `compare`/`analysis` are narrowings of it. Two
 * signals would have let both be open, in a row whose whole layout rule is "two
 * equal halves or one whole".
 *
 * ── The dependency arrow, and why it never runs back ────────────────────────
 *
 * Notice ← Documents ← **Stage** ← PositionSync (docs/PLAN.md §4, unit 8c). This
 * file reads and calls `OpenDocumentsService`; that file knows nothing about this
 * one. The thing that makes that possible is `active` being a COMPUTED rather
 * than a signal this class writes and maintains: closing a document is a fact
 * about the LIST, and the moment the list stops holding what the pointer names,
 * the stage answers Home by construction. `OpenDocumentsService.close` therefore
 * has nothing to tidy up, and cannot forget to.
 *
 * THE RAW POINTER LIVES ONE SERVICE DOWN, and that is the one thing about this
 * arrangement worth reading twice. Every door that opens a document ends by
 * putting it in front of the person — `adopt`, `relocate`, `openFinished`,
 * `openExportView`, `openAwaitedBooks` — and four of those five are driven by an
 * IPC callback or by an effect of the documents service, so there is no caller to
 * hoist the showing up to this class. Rather than have that file announce an
 * intention for this one to act on (a wire with a delay in it where a signal
 * write used to be), the raw write stays where the doors are and the MEANING
 * stays here. See `OpenDocumentsService.pointer`.

/**
 * WHAT THE SECOND COLUMN IS, WHEN THERE IS ONE — one of exactly two things.
 *
 * ── Why a union and not two nullable signals ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because the workspace's layout rule is *"two equal halves or one whole"* (the
 * standing ruling, argued in the `.row` styles) and two independent signals can
 * be true at once. A union cannot: the panel and the comparison occupy one slot,
 * and opening either puts the other away by construction rather than by every
 * call site remembering to. docs/ANALYSIS.md §8 names this shape for exactly that
 * reason.
 *
 * BOTH MEMBERS CARRY THE SAME TWO FIELDS, and that is not an argument for
 * collapsing them into one record with a `kind`. They mean different things: a
 * comparison's step is a row of the book to be drawn read-only beside the live
 * one, and an analysis's step is the row whose PAYLOAD is a report about the book.
 * Discriminating them is what stops a column resolving one as the other — and it
 * is what makes `compare` and `analysis` below narrowings rather than guesses.

   *
   * THE PROJECT RIDES WITH THE STEP because a step id alone is not enough to know

   * A second column has to end in three ways, and a signal somebody has to

   *   THE SHOWN DOCUMENT'S PROJECT CHANGED — they clicked another book. The
   *   recorded directory no longer matches the live one and the column goes with
   *   the book it belonged to.
   *
   *   THE STEP WAS DELETED — the ledger this window holds no longer has a row
   *   with that id. A delete rewrites the held ledger (`LedgerService` re-reads on
   *   `projects:changed`, which every delete fires), so the row vanishing from the
   *   list IS the announcement, read where it lands rather than subscribed to
   *   somewhere else and hoped for.
   *
   * ALL THREE ARE ASKED OF BOTH ARMS, and that is the point of extending this

   * pointed at an analysis STEP — the row whose payload is the report — so
   * "deleted while the panel was open" is the identical fact about the identical
   * list, and a second implementation of it would be a second chance to leave a
   * column open over a row that is gone.
   *
   * A LEDGER THIS WINDOW HAS NOT READ YET IS NOT A CLEAR. `historyFor` answers
   * null while a project's history is still in flight, and treating that silence
   * as "the step is gone" would close the column somebody just opened. The wish
   * survives an unread ledger and is judged the moment there is a list to judge it
