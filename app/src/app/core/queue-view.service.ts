/**
 * THE QUEUE AS IT IS DRAWN — one description of the board, read by both surfaces
 * that draw it.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists at all ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every sentence in here used to be a protected method on the queue shelf, which
 * was fine while the shelf was the only place a job was ever shown. Owen asked
 * for two places (his ruling is quoted in full at the head of the queue bar):
 * a dropdown you click open from the top-right corner, and a whole page behind a
 * *More info* button. Two surfaces onto one queue is exactly the arrangement
 * BookForge landed on — its tray and its queue page both read one service, and
 * its own note about that is the argument for this one: *"Both read
 * `shared/queue/bench.ts` now, so there is one description of the queue and one
 * set of words for it."* Before that they *"spoke different dialects"*.
 *
 * So the shelf's own answers moved here rather than being copied into two
 * components. Copying them would have been a drift machine with a two-week fuse:
 * the day somebody fixes the failure sentence, or teaches `made()` a new kind, or
 * changes which lane the aggregate bar follows, they fix it in the surface they
 * happened to have open and the other one goes on saying the old thing. A queue
 * that says two different things about one job in two places is worse than
 * either sentence alone, because now the user has to work out which to believe.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is not a second queue. `QueueService` is the mirror of main's list and this
 * reads it; nothing here writes a job, guesses a state, or holds anything of its
 * own between renders. Every computed below is a pure function of
 * `queue.jobs()`, and the three methods that DO something (`open`, `reveal`,
 * `saveCopy`) are the same one-line hand-offs the shelf made — they are here
 * because they belong to a row, and a row is drawn in two places now.
 *
 * It is also not a scheduler. The lanes, the slot counts and the resource of
 * each kind are `shared/queue-board.ts` — the same table `electron/job-queue.ts`
 * rations by — read and never second-guessed, so the lane a row is DRAWN in
 * cannot disagree with the lane the pump holds it against.

   * What actually went wrong, out of the engine's whole stderr.
   *
   * THE FIRST LINE IS NEVER THE ANSWER, and showing it was a bug that hid every
   * failure this app can have. `job.error` is the engine's ENTIRE stderr, and
   * foundry's first line is always a configuration echo — which endpoint it is
   * using and which file said so. Every failed conversion therefore reported
   * the same harmless sentence, whatever had actually happened, and the real
   * message sat at the far end of a string nobody could see.
   *
   * The engine's contract makes the right line findable: `src/cli.ts` prints a
   * fatal as `foundry: <message>` and exits, so the LAST line beginning that
   * way is the failure. A run that died without one — killed, or a crash in a
   * child — has no such line, and then the last thing it managed to say is the
   * most informative thing there is.
   *
   * The whole stderr stays in the row's `title`, because the sentence is the
   * headline and the progress above it is often the context that explains it.
