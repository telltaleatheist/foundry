/**
 * The open documents — the list down the left, and the one place that knows
 * which is which.
 *
 * TABS ARE RENDERER STATE, on purpose. Main owns everything with a lifetime — a
 * conversion, an unpacked book's temp directory, the allow-list — but which of
 * them is on screen and in what order is a window's own business, and pushing
 * that through IPC would make a reload of the renderer able to disturb it.
 *
 * The one door in is `document:opened`. The menu, the dialog, a drop, a path on
 * argv and a conversion that just finished all reach main first (which decides
 * whether the file is openable at all) and arrive back here as that event. So
 * this service never has to decide whether a path is real, and there is exactly
 * one code path that creates a tab.
 *
 * ── Panes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The workspace is one to five PANES side by side, and A PANE HOLDS A STACK OF
 * DOCUMENTS AND SHOWS ONE OF THEM. They exist for one comparison in particular:
 * a book beside its translation, the German page and the English page under two
 * hands at once. Everything else about panes follows from that, including the
 * auto-open rule (a translation lands in a pane of its OWN, so it appears beside
 * its source rather than on top of it).
 *
 * ── The strips came back, and this comment is the reversal ───────────────────
 *
 * EACH PANE USED TO CARRY A CHROME-STYLE STRIP of its own — VS Code's editor
 * groups, a stack of tabs per column — and this paragraph used to record why
 * they were taken away: five columns on a 1920-wide window give each strip 370
 * pixels, three tabs in one of them are unreadable stubs, and a VERTICAL LIST in
 * a panel of its own (app-open-documents) does not degrade with the number of
 * columns. Every word of that is still true and it was still the wrong trade,
 * because it measured the strip as a NAVIGATOR and the strip's job was never
 * only navigation.
 *
 * The user specced them back, in these words: *"clicking another file will
 * automatically close the one i was looking at and open the one i just clicked,
 * unless i pin the file by right-clicking the chrome-style tab at the top"*, and
 * *"if they grab the tab and drag it to one of the sides, it enters split screen
 * with the tab that was currently active when they dragged it"*. PIN, DRAG-SPLIT
 * AND CLOSE are what a strip is for this time — three gestures that need
 * something to point at, and a vertical list of every document in the window
 * cannot be that something, because none of the three is about the window. They
 * are about THIS COLUMN: what it is holding, what it may throw away when the next
 * click lands, and what it should tear off into a column of its own.
 *
 * The narrow-strip complaint is answered by the auto-close rule rather than by
 * removing the strip: a column accumulates tabs only where somebody PINNED one,
 * so the ordinary five-column window has one tab per strip and reads exactly as
 * it did without them. The documents list stays — it is the project and export
 * navigator, which is a different job, and it is still the only place a
 * document's order in the WINDOW lives.
 *
 * THE TABS STAY IN ONE FLAT LIST and the panes hold ids into it. A pane owning
 * whole Tab objects would put `patch()` — the one function every edit, save and
 * flag in this file goes through — behind a search of a list of lists, and the
 * first thing to rot would be an edit landing in one pane's copy of a tab while
 * another pane showed the other. One list, one identity per tab; the panes
 * decide only where each is shown and which of theirs is on top.
 *
 * A DOCUMENT IS IN AT MOST ONE PANE, and the strips did not weaken that. It is
 * in at most one STRIP: clicking a row for something already on screen REVEALS
 * it rather than putting a second viewer over one unpack — the rule `adopt()`
 * has always enforced for files — and dragging a tab between strips MOVES it.
 * Two panes on one tab would also share its `chapterHref`, so the two columns
 * would look scroll-locked to each other for reasons nothing on screen explains.
 *
 * ONE PANE IS FOCUSED, and it is what the rail, the menu and the keyboard mean
 * by "the document": `active()` is the focused pane's document and nothing else.
 * With a single pane open, that is exactly the app that existed before panes did
 * — the feature is meant to be invisible until it is used.
 *
 * ── TWO KINDS, WHICH IS WHERE R6c LEFT IT ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There were four. `epub` was an unpacked book served to a sandboxed <iframe>
 * and `editor` was that book's markup in a textarea beside it, and both are
 * deleted with the editing world they belonged to (docs/RENDERER.md §7). What is
 * left is a document this app SHOWS and a book this app EDITS.
 */

/**
 * `book` IS THE ONE KIND THAT IS NOT A FILE.
 *
 * `pdf` is a document on disk — a scan or a facsimile, shown and never edited
 * (docs/RENDERER.md §0 A1). A `book` tab is the project's BOOK — the reflowed blocks the renderer draws on the proof sheet
 * (docs/RENDERER.md §5) — which does not live in any one file the user opens: it
 * is made from the bank at the position, main decides which bank that is, and the
 * renderer never learns where it is kept. So the tab carries the PROJECT
 * DIRECTORY in `path` and asks main for the rows by naming it.
 *
 * That is why `projectDirOf` has a case for this kind and nothing else does: for
 * every other tab the project is the folder the file is IN, and for this one the
 * path IS the project.

 * THE BOOK PANE'S STACK, as everything outside that pane needs it.
 *
 * ── Why a wire exists at all, when the selection deliberately has none ──────
 *
 * The book pane keeps its selection to itself on a stated rule: surface-local
 * state stays local until something else genuinely needs it, and a wire with
 * nothing on either end is worse than no wire. The stack is the case where
 * something else does need it, and TWO things do.
 *
 * THE UNDO CHORD IS ROUTED, not listened for. Ctrl+Z is a menu accelerator that
 * main swallows on its way past, and the renderer decides which of the undos a
 * chord meant — a text box's, the rendered frame's, or the book's
 * (`MenuAction`, shared/api.ts). `replay` is where that decision is made, and a
 * global key listener added by the pane would be a second answer fighting the
 * first.
 *
 * AND CLOSING IS ASKED ABOUT IN ONE PLACE. `questionBefore` is the one dialog a
 * closing tab gets, on this file's own ruling that a person shutting a book is
 * asked once about everything it costs. The stack is in memory and closing
 * genuinely scraps it (docs/RENDERER.md §3), so that question has to be able to
 * see it — and, because a card whose only route to keeping the work is *cancel,
 * find Apply, close again* has made the user do the app's job, it has to be able
 * to press Apply too.
 *
 * IT IS AN INTERFACE THE PANE IMPLEMENTS rather than state this service holds,
 * which is the whole of what keeps the ruling intact: the ops still live in the
 * component that makes them, and what crosses the boundary is a set of questions
 * and a set of verbs.
 *
 * ── AND NOW THE PANELS, WHICH IS WHY IT GREW ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Notes, Furniture review and Chapters live in the app shell and keep its dark
 * style (RENDERER-DESIGN.md §5), which puts them OUTSIDE the pane whose stack
 * their every gesture pushes onto. A panel that kept its own list of notes would
 * be a second account of the book — the exact failure the replay exists to make
 * impossible — so what crosses here is the pane's OWN replay, read as a signal,
 * and one verb that puts ops on the pane's own stack. Undo, redo and Apply then
 * take a panel's decision back exactly as they take a decision made on the paper,
 * because there is one stack and it is the pane's.
 *
 * THE SELECTION CROSSED WITH THEM, and it crossed as a QUESTION rather than as
 * state. The pane's own rule was that its selection stays local *until something
 * else genuinely needs it* — "the day the inspector can act on it, it moves up".
 * That day is this one: "a chapter starts at the selected block" is a panel

 * in no undo stack and still gone on a reload; the panel reads it and cannot

     * THE POINTER MOVED, SO THE PANES SHOW THE STEP THE USER IS STANDING ON.
     *
     * ── What clicking a row used to do, which was very nearly nothing ────────
     *
     * `docs/STEP-LEDGER.md` has promised since the day the ledger was designed
     * that the position decides what the viewers show, and this effect used to
     * keep about a third of that promise. It re-read the CURATION and left the
     * blocks under it exactly where they were, which is correct only while both
     * rows are about one reading: move between two readings and the pane went on
     * drawing the first reading's boxes with the second reading's corrections over
     * them, silently, with nothing on screen admitting the swap. And it was
     * guarded on the pane already being in the block editor, so for a scan nobody
     * had pressed Blocks on — and for the import row, where the honest picture is
     * no outlines at all — a click on a row in somebody's own history did
     * literally nothing. That is what a user with a two-step project saw: they
     * clicked the import, they clicked the read, and the app sat there.
     *
     * ── What it does now: make the pane match the answer ─────────────────────
     *
     * `positionView` (shared/ledger.ts) says what the picture at the position IS —
     * which reading's bank, which corrections over it, whether there are outlines
     * at all — and this effect's whole job is to make the panes of that project
     * agree with it. Nothing here re-derives any of that; the day a read row comes
     * to mean a reflowed HTML document rather than a scan with boxes on it
     * (docs/DERIVED-BOOK.md §6 phase B), the answer changes shape and this loop
     * does not.
     *
     * A MOVE THAT CHANGES THE BANK RELOADS; A MOVE THAT CHANGES ONLY THE
     * CORRECTIONS DOES NOT. Re-reading a bank is a spawn of the engine and a
     * re-measure of five hundred pages, and putting that behind the one gesture in
     * this app that is meant to be free is the exact ceremony a history panel
     * promises it does not have. So a save and the reading it was made from — two
     * rows, one bank — cost one small file read between them, and only a genuinely
     * different reading pays for the blocks. `positionPicture` is what makes that
     * distinction; the step id would have been wrong in both directions.
     *
     * ── Keyed by PROJECT, and the first sighting is a baseline ───────────────
     *
     * By project because the position is a fact about a book rather than about a
     * viewer of one, and because two panes onto one project must not each decide
     * separately what that book is standing on.
     *
     * THE FIRST SIGHTING RECORDS AND ACTS ON NOTHING. Opening a document must
     * not be read as a move. A pointer move is a
     * DIFFERENCE from what this window was last showing, and a project it has
     * never seen has no difference to be. The entry is dropped again when the last

     * THE POSITION DID NOT MOVE AND THE DOCUMENT UNDER IT DID.
     *
     * ── Why the picture above cannot see this by itself ────────────────────────
     *
     * `positionPicture` (shared/ledger.ts) is composed of the reading, the
     * corrections and — for a row that shows its own payload — the row: the three
     * things the LEDGER knows that decide what is on screen. Which file a read row
     * actually resolves to is not one of them, and cannot be: it is main's
     * bookkeeping, answered over IPC (`ledger:document-at`), and the effect above
     * is synchronous. So a project standing still while its document changes
     * underneath is invisible to that key by construction.
     *
     * And it changed, on the path this app cared most about, for as long as a
     * position could resolve to one document and then to another: main answered a
     * read row that came back as the scan by casting the book, so seconds later
     * the same position resolved to an EPUB with nothing in the ledger having
     * moved. There are no casts now (docs/RENDERER.md §7) and a read row is drawn
     * on the sheet, so that particular swap cannot happen — but the effect stays,
     * because the reason it was built is the complaint it was built for: *"i
     * wanted the document to show."*
     *
     * ── An effect of its own, on the delete effect's precedent ─────────────────
     *
     * The same shape as "a step was deleted, so the panes read their state again"
     * above: a fact the position cannot express, on a trigger of its own, acting
     * only where something actually CHANGED. `projects.items()` is that trigger —
     * main announces the projects whenever a catalogue does anything, which
     * includes the landing that files a cast — and the acting is `showPosition`,
     * the one door that puts a position's document on screen.
     *
     * IT ASKS MAIN AND NEVER GUESSES. Reading the catalogue here to work out
     * whether a cast has appeared would be a second opinion about a resolution
     * that is deliberately main's alone (`showPosition` says why at length), and
     * it would be wrong in exactly the place it is dearest — a branch read, a
     * rotated cast. One IPC per open project per announce, and announces are
     * landings and imports rather than keystrokes.
     *
     * THE FIRST ANSWER FOR A PROJECT IS A BASELINE AND MOVES NOTHING, which is
     * the position effect's own first-sighting rule said about the document
     * instead of the picture: a window that has just met a project has no
     * difference to act on.
     *
     * A BASELINE IS NOT A NO-OP ANY MORE, THOUGH — see the position effect above,
     * which now asks for the document at a position it is meeting for the first
     * time instead of leaving it unknown until something announces.

   * it was: `Tab.path` is fixed when a document is opened from the documents panel

   * made from its reading showed one of them however many rows were clicked —
   * *"switching between steps doesnt switch between the original pdf and the
   * rendered facsimile like i expected"* — and when there was nothing this could
   * change it put a sentence on the strip instead, which is the half the user was
   * angrier about: *"i wanted the document to show. instead of showing the
   * document, it gave me an error saying it couldnt show the document… it should be
   * showing me document"*.
   *
   * ── The ruling this is built to ─────────────────────────────────────────────

   * not open at all, open it. Nothing here reports a state it could have fixed,
   * which is why this function no longer has a sentence to say.

   * ── The three pictures over it, and what each costs ─────────────────────────
   *
   * NO OUTLINES (the import, and any position with no reading above it): the pane
   * comes out of the block editor. Nothing had been read at that point in the
   * book's story, so boxes drawn there would be the pane making a claim about a
   * step the user is standing BEFORE — which is the one thing the revert row exists
   * to let somebody look at without.
   *
   * OUTLINES, PANE NOT IN THE MODE: it goes into the mode and reads the bank. The
   * expensive one, and it is expensive exactly once per genuinely different
   * picture.
   *
   * OUTLINES, PANE ALREADY IN THE MODE: the bank is re-read if the READING moved,
   * or if the pages under it changed — a document swap is a different PDF, and
   * boxes measured against the old one would be drawn over the new one's pages.

   * showing it, and they were told to go and click it in the list. Doing it for
   * them is the whole of the fix.
   *
   * A PDF THIS PROJECT ALREADY HAS A TAB FOR: the tab MOVES to the new file. One
   * document per project per pane is what makes "the pane shows the step" true;
   * opening the scan beside the reprint would leave two tabs with the same book's
   * name in the list and neither of them following the pointer. `app-pdf-view`
   * watches `tab.path` and re-opens when the string changes, so the swap is the
   * patch and nothing else — the same mechanism `relocate` uses when an import
   * moves a tab onto the project's copy.
   *
   * ANYTHING ELSE: opened, through the one door every open in this app goes
   * through. That covers a translation's EPUB, which is emphatically NOT swapped
   * into a PDF tab — a book is UNPACKED, and patching a path would leave a viewer
   * serving chapters out of a tree belonging to a different book — and it covers a
   * project whose document nobody has open. `adopt` refuses to make a second tab
   * for a file already open, so this cannot double up.
   *
   * ── Which tab follows the pointer, when the project has several ─────────────
   *
   * The one in the focused column first, then any in a column, then any at all —
   * and ONLY of the kind the target is. A person comparing the scan against the
   * cast EPUB has two tabs of one project on screen, and swapping the EPUB's pane
   * to a PDF because they clicked a read row would take away the book they were
   * reading to answer a question about the pages.
   *
   * ── AND A CHANGE OF KIND IS AN OPEN, NEVER A PATCH ──────────────────────────
   *
   * The position's document can now change KIND under a click: the import row
   * answers the scan and the read and curate rows answer the EPUB cast from the
   * reading (docs/WORKBENCH.md §4, Unit E). Patching a path across that boundary
   * would leave a PDF viewer pointed at a book — or an unpacked book's viewer
   * serving chapters out of a tree belonging to a scan — so the two documents
   * become two TABS IN ONE STRIP, and clicking between the steps activates
   * between them. That is the whole reason the strips are back in a form that can
   * hold more than one thing: nothing threads "this is a PDF" through the
   * renderer, the seam is position → document → show it (DERIVED-BOOK §7), and a
   * strip is what lets one column show whichever of a project's faces the
   * position names without throwing the other away.
   *
   * The same-kind swap SURVIVES for PDF↔PDF, and it is worth keeping for the one
   * thing it does that opening cannot: `app-pdf-view` keeps the page you were on
   * when the path under it moves, and a scan re-opened as a second tab would land
   * you back at page one of a five-hundred-page book.

   *
   * Generating a real-text PDF appeared to do nothing at all. The run finished,
   * the shelf said so, and the page on screen did not change — because a
   * PDF-producing rendering REPLACES the project's live PDF at the same path
   * (`refreshLivePdf`), `adopt` finds a tab already on that path and merely
   * reveals it, and `app-pdf-view` re-reads only when the path STRING changes.
   * Same name, new bytes, and every layer of the app faithfully concluded there
   * was nothing to do.
   *
   * So a document already open is REVEALED AND RELOADED. The revision bump is
   * this app's own idiom for exactly this — it is what makes an edited chapter
   * repaint in an <iframe> pointed at a URL it is already showing — and the PDF
   * pane now watches it for the same reason.
   *
   * A document that is NOT open takes the ordinary path and opens fresh.
   *
   * ── A COLUMN OF ITS OWN, EXCEPT WHERE THAT IS A SECOND COLUMN OF ONE BOOK ───
   *
   * The pane-of-its-own rule was written for the translation and it is right for
   * the translation: it runs for hours, the person who ordered it is not
   * watching, and the whole point of it appearing is that they can read it
   * AGAINST the source. Two columns is the feature.
   *
   * A READING NOW CASTS THE BOOK BY ITSELF (docs/WORKBENCH.md §4, Unit E), and
   * nobody asked for that one at all. Under the old rule it arrived as a new
   * column, unbidden, next to the scan it was cast from — and then the position
   * effect, which is the thing that actually MEANT to put it on screen, found it
   * already in a column and merely focused it. Two mechanisms, one book, and a
   * column the user did not arrange: the read step's document turning up as
   * furniture rather than as the step's document.
   *
   * So a landing whose project is already open in a column JOINS THAT COLUMN'S
   * STRIP — it is another face of the same book, the same thing clicking the read
   * row means — and only a translation still insists on a column of its own,
   * because only a translation is a thing to be read beside rather than instead.

   * outside path, because the import is deliberately not awaited and there was
   * nothing else to name at the moment the tab was made.
   *
   * Everything then asked the wrong question. `projectFor(tab.path)` answers
   * null for a path outside the library, so Generate said a book that had just
   * been read had not been read, the dock's waiting light stayed lit on a
   * finished project, the nav could not group the document under its own book,
   * and the block editor had no bank to fetch. One stale string, six broken
   * features, and nothing on screen to explain any of it.
   *
   * ── The same tab, never a second one ────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * `adopt` would make a new tab for the new path, which is exactly the failure
   * this exists to prevent: two viewers onto one document, two scroll positions,
   * and the user watching their book apparently open twice. So this PATCHES —
   * the tab keeps its id, its pane, its ledger, its selection and its place in
   * the list, and only its idea of where the file is changes.
   *
   * A PDF pane reloads by itself: `app-pdf-view` watches `tab.path` through a
   * computed and re-opens when the string changes, which is a repaint of the
   * same pages from the same bytes. A book does not reload at all — it is
   * already unpacked, and it is unpacked from the SAME project, because the
   * import is keyed by the file's content and both paths reach it.
   *
   * `savedPath` MOVES WITH IT WHEN IT NAMED THE FILE WE ARE LEAVING. It is a
   * grant — for a book opened from the user's own disk it names their file, and
   * Save updating the copy they chose is what they asked for by opening it — but
   * that stops being true the moment the tab stops showing that file. A Save
   * that repacked the working tree over a document on another drive, while every
   * label on screen said the library's copy, is the same invariant `meta:write-pdf`
   * broke: THE APP NEVER SILENTLY WRITES OUTSIDE ITS LIBRARY. Main revokes the
   * matching grant in the same breath. Where `savedPath` names something else
   * entirely — a Save As the user made — it is left exactly alone.

   * of this exists anywhere you chose" — which is true FROM BIRTH of every book
   * this app opens out of a project, because the project IS where it lives. So
   * closing a tab somebody had done nothing but look at raised a dialog about a
   * loss that had not happened, and a warning that fires when nothing is at stake
   * is how a person learns to dismiss the one that matters. The user ruled on it
   * in a sentence: *"only pop up a confirmation alert if changes have been
   * made."*
   *
   * It is also a warning that outlived its workflow. It was written when Save put
   * a copy somewhere of the user's choosing and the app could reasonably say "you
   * have not done that yet"; saving is the export modal's job now
   * (docs/WORKBENCH.md §6), a project tab that closes loses track of nothing, and
   * Home still lists the book. The DOT stays — `Tab.unsaved` is a fact worth
   * drawing — but it is not a reason to stop somebody on their way out.

   * ── ONE QUESTION FOR TWO LOSSES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * A book's filed copy can be out of date, and a scan's corrections can have no
   * save to come back to. Main composes whichever of the two are true into one
   * card, because this codebase has already ruled that a closing document is
   * asked about once (`closeShowing`): a second dialog on top of the first is the
   * app arguing with an answer it already has.
   *
   * ── And the offer to keep the work is a button, not advice ─────────────────
   *
   * A dialog whose only route to keeping the work is *cancel, hunt for Apply,
   * close again* has made the user do the app's job, and the way that ends is
   * that they stop reading the box. So the answer can be "apply these changes,
   * then close" — and it goes through the pane's own `apply`, the same path the
   * sheet's own button takes, rather than a second commit written for this
   * dialog. AN APPLY MAIN REFUSES LEAVES THE TAB OPEN: closing anyway would have
   * thrown away the very thing the answer asked to keep, and main's own sentence
   * is already in the notice strip saying why it would not land.
