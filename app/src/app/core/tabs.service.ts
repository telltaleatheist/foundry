/**
 * The open documents — the list down the left, and the one place that knows
 * which is which.
 *
 * TABS ARE RENDERER STATE, on purpose. Main owns everything with a lifetime — a
 * conversion, an unpacked book's temp directory, the allow-list — but which of
 * them is on screen and in what order is a window's own business, and pushing
 * that through IPC would make a reload of the renderer able to disturb it.
 *
 * The one door in is `document:opened`. The menu, the dialog, a drop, a path on
 * argv and a conversion that just finished all reach main first (which decides
 * whether the file is openable at all) and arrive back here as that event. So
 * this service never has to decide whether a path is real, and there is exactly
 * one code path that creates a tab.
 *
 * ── ONE VIEWER, AND THIS COMMENT IS THE SECOND REVERSAL ─────────────────────
 *
 * This paragraph used to describe PANES — one to five columns side by side, each
 * holding a stack of documents and showing one of them — and the paragraph after
 * it recorded the reversal that brought each column's CHROME-STYLE STRIP back,
 * with pin, drag-split and close as the three gestures a strip was for. Both are
 * gone, and they are gone by the same ruling (2026-08-17):
 *
 *   *"i dont think we should have tabs in foundry. i think its making things a
 *   bit confusing. however, the user should be able to compare two steps
 *   sometimes. so i think the solution is to have a single viewer window/single
 *   tab, and if the user wants to compare two steps, theres a compare button
 *   they can click and then they can choose the step to compare."*
 *
 * So: ONE VIEWER SHOWING ONE DOCUMENT. No columns, no strips, no pin, no
 * drag-split, no dividers, no drag shield, no five-column cap and no Ctrl+1…5.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A CLIMBDOWN FROM THE COMPARISON — the comparison was the panes'
 * whole founding argument (a book beside its translation, the German page and
 * the English page under two hands at once) and it OUTLIVED them by being built
 * somewhere better. app-book-view draws the translation beside its source as the
 * Aligned pair, inside one viewer, scroll-linked, for the one comparison anybody
 * actually made. What the columns were left carrying was the ability to arrange
 * furniture, and the price of that was two selectors again: which column has the
 * focus, and which step the project is standing on. Compare comes back as a
 * BUTTON on the single viewer (docs/PLAN.md §4, unit 8d) — a chosen step beside
 * the live one — which is the same capability with none of the arithmetic.
 *
 * THE TABS STAY IN ONE FLAT LIST, and now it is the only list there is. It was
 * already flat under the panes, on the rule that `patch()` — the one function
 * every edit, save and flag in this file goes through — must never have to search
 * a list of lists. What went with the columns is the second structure that held
 * ids INTO it; the order in the list is the documents panel's, through `reorder`,
 * and nothing else records a sequence.
 *
 * ONE DOCUMENT IS SHOWN, and it is what the rail, the menu and the keyboard mean
 * by "the document": `active()` is its id and `activeDocument()` is the tab.
 * NULL IS HOME — exactly what an empty column used to be — or, where the window
 * is still holding a project, the empty bench that says a step is one click away.
 * Opening anything replaces what is shown; nothing is lost by that, because the
 * displaced document is still open in the list with its unpack, its edits and its
 * dot, one click from coming back. That is the user's own rule from the strips'
 * day (*"clicking another file will automatically close the one i was looking
 * at"*) with the exception — the pin — taken off it, which is why replacing needs
 * no flag: it is the only behaviour there is.
 *
 * A DOCUMENT HAS AT MOST ONE TAB, unchanged and load-bearing. Clicking a row for
 * something already open REVEALS it rather than putting a second viewer over one
 * unpack — the rule `adopt()` has always enforced for files.
 *
 * ── TWO KINDS, WHICH IS WHERE R6c LEFT IT ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There were four. `epub` was an unpacked book served to a sandboxed <iframe>
 * and `editor` was that book's markup in a textarea beside it, and both are
 * deleted with the editing world they belonged to (docs/RENDERER.md §7). What is
 * left is a document this app SHOWS and a book this app EDITS.
 */

/**
 * `book` IS THE ONE KIND THAT IS NOT A FILE.
 *
 * `pdf` is a document on disk — a scan or a facsimile, shown and never edited
 * (docs/RENDERER.md §0 A1). A `book` tab is the project's BOOK — the reflowed blocks the renderer draws on the proof sheet
 * (docs/RENDERER.md §5) — which does not live in any one file the user opens: it
 * is made from the bank at the position, main decides which bank that is, and the
 * renderer never learns where it is kept. So the tab carries the PROJECT
 * DIRECTORY in `path` and asks main for the rows by naming it.
 *
 * That is why `projectDirOf` has a case for this kind and nothing else does: for
 * every other tab the project is the folder the file is IN, and for this one the
 * path IS the project.

/**
 * THE BOOK PANE'S STACK, as everything outside that pane needs it.
 *
 * ── Why a wire exists at all, when the selection deliberately has none ──────
 *
 * The book pane keeps its selection to itself on a stated rule: surface-local
 * state stays local until something else genuinely needs it, and a wire with
 * nothing on either end is worse than no wire. The stack is the case where
 * something else does need it, and TWO things do.
 *
 * THE UNDO CHORD IS ROUTED, not listened for. Ctrl+Z is a menu accelerator that
 * main swallows on its way past, and the renderer decides which of the undos a
 * chord meant — a text box's, the rendered frame's, or the book's
 * (`MenuAction`, shared/api.ts). `replay` is where that decision is made, and a
 * global key listener added by the pane would be a second answer fighting the
 * first.
 *
 * AND CLOSING IS ASKED ABOUT IN ONE PLACE. `questionBefore` is the one dialog a
 * closing tab gets, on this file's own ruling that a person shutting a book is
 * asked once about everything it costs. The stack is in memory and closing
 * genuinely scraps it (docs/RENDERER.md §3), so that question has to be able to
 * see it — and, because a card whose only route to keeping the work is *cancel,
 * find Apply, close again* has made the user do the app's job, it has to be able
 * to press Apply too.
 *
 * IT IS AN INTERFACE THE PANE IMPLEMENTS rather than state this service holds,
 * which is the whole of what keeps the ruling intact: the ops still live in the
 * component that makes them, and what crosses the boundary is a set of questions
 * and a set of verbs.
 *
 * ── AND NOW THE PANELS, WHICH IS WHY IT GREW ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Notes, Furniture review and Chapters live in the app shell and keep its dark
 * style (RENDERER-DESIGN.md §5), which puts them OUTSIDE the pane whose stack
 * their every gesture pushes onto. A panel that kept its own list of notes would
 * be a second account of the book — the exact failure the replay exists to make
 * impossible — so what crosses here is the pane's OWN replay, read as a signal,
 * and one verb that puts ops on the pane's own stack. Undo, redo and Apply then
 * take a panel's decision back exactly as they take a decision made on the paper,
 * because there is one stack and it is the pane's.
 *
 * THE SELECTION CROSSED WITH THEM, and it crossed as a QUESTION rather than as
 * state. The pane's own rule was that its selection stays local *until something
 * else genuinely needs it* — "the day the inspector can act on it, it moves up".
 * That day is this one: "a chapter starts at the selected block" is a panel

     * be "in a pane of its OWN, beside the book it was made from" — the columns'
     * founding argument, applied to the one job that runs long enough to need it
     * — and with one viewer there is nowhere for a beside. Nothing is lost that
     * the user asked to keep: the book it was made from is still open in the

     * opening: a reload should not reopen five books somebody closed.
     *
     * A SAVE'S OWN BOOK IS THE EXCEPTION, and it is the one job here nobody
     * ordered. Applying changes casts the book as of that save (`forStep`, the
     * per-save cast), which is a rendering the app made for itself so that
     * standing on an older save shows the book that save made — and it lands in
     * the middle of somebody correcting the next paragraph. Every other job in

     * THE POINTER MOVED, SO THE VIEWER SHOWS THE STEP THE USER IS STANDING ON.
     *
     * ── What clicking a row used to do, which was very nearly nothing ────────
     *
     * `docs/STEP-LEDGER.md` has promised since the day the ledger was designed
     * that the position decides what the viewers show, and this effect used to
     * keep about a third of that promise. It re-read the CURATION and left the
     * blocks under it exactly where they were, which is correct only while both
     * rows are about one reading: move between two readings and the viewer went on
     * drawing the first reading's boxes with the second reading's corrections over
     * them, silently, with nothing on screen admitting the swap. And it was
     * guarded on the viewer already being in the block editor, so for a scan nobody
     * had pressed Blocks on — and for the import row, where the honest picture is
     * no outlines at all — a click on a row in somebody's own history did
     * literally nothing. That is what a user with a two-step project saw: they
     * clicked the import, they clicked the read, and the app sat there.
     *
     * ── What it does now: make the viewer match the answer ───────────────────
     *
     * `positionView` (shared/ledger.ts) says what the picture at the position IS —
     * which reading's bank, which corrections over it, whether there are outlines
     * at all — and this effect's whole job is to make the viewer, where it is
     * pointed at that project, agree with it. Nothing here re-derives any of
     * that; the day a read row comes
     * to mean a reflowed HTML document rather than a scan with boxes on it
     * (docs/DERIVED-BOOK.md §6 phase B), the answer changes shape and this loop
     * does not.
     *
     * A MOVE THAT CHANGES THE BANK RELOADS; A MOVE THAT CHANGES ONLY THE
     * CORRECTIONS DOES NOT. Re-reading a bank is a spawn of the engine and a
     * re-measure of five hundred pages, and putting that behind the one gesture in
     * this app that is meant to be free is the exact ceremony a history panel
     * promises it does not have. So a save and the reading it was made from — two
     * rows, one bank — cost one small file read between them, and only a genuinely
     * different reading pays for the blocks. `positionPicture` is what makes that
     * distinction; the step id would have been wrong in both directions.
     *
     * ── Keyed by PROJECT, and the first sighting is a baseline ───────────────
     *
     * By project because the position is a fact about a book rather than about a
     * viewer of one. It stays keyed that way with a single viewer because the
     * memory it holds is per BOOK: five books can be open with one on screen, and
     * the four that are not still have a position this window has to remember
     * having painted.
     *
     * THE FIRST SIGHTING RECORDS, AND MOVES NOTHING EXCEPT ONTO THE SHEET.
     * Opening a document must not be read as a move: a pointer move is a
     * DIFFERENCE from what this window was last showing, and a project it has
     * never seen has no difference to be. The entry is dropped again when the last
     * tab of that project closes, so a reopen baselines afresh rather than
     * inheriting a picture from a session nobody is in any more.
     *
     * BUT A SHEET POSITION IS NOT A DIFFERENCE — IT IS THE PICTURE. See
     * `openTheSheet` below for the complaint, and for why the exception is exactly

     * THE POSITION DID NOT MOVE AND THE DOCUMENT UNDER IT DID.
     *
     * ── Why the picture above cannot see this by itself ────────────────────────
     *
     * `positionPicture` (shared/ledger.ts) is composed of the reading, the
     * corrections and — for a row that shows its own payload — the row: the three
     * things the LEDGER knows that decide what is on screen. Which file a read row
     * actually resolves to is not one of them, and cannot be: it is main's
     * bookkeeping, answered over IPC (`ledger:document-at`), and the effect above
     * is synchronous. So a project standing still while its document changes
     * underneath is invisible to that key by construction.
     *
     * And it changed, on the path this app cared most about, for as long as a
     * position could resolve to one document and then to another: main answered a
     * read row that came back as the scan by casting the book, so seconds later
     * the same position resolved to an EPUB with nothing in the ledger having
     * moved. There are no casts now (docs/RENDERER.md §7) and a read row is drawn
     * on the sheet, so that particular swap cannot happen — but the effect stays,
     * because the reason it was built is the complaint it was built for: *"i
     * wanted the document to show."*
     *
     * ── An effect of its own, on the delete effect's precedent ─────────────────
     *
     * The same shape as "a step was deleted, so the viewer reads its state again"
     * above: a fact the position cannot express, on a trigger of its own, acting
     * only where something actually CHANGED. `projects.items()` is that trigger —
     * main announces the projects whenever a catalogue does anything, which
     * includes the landing that files a cast — and the acting is `showPosition`,
     * the one door that puts a position's document on screen.
     *
     * IT ASKS MAIN AND NEVER GUESSES. Reading the catalogue here to work out
     * whether a cast has appeared would be a second opinion about a resolution
     * that is deliberately main's alone (`showPosition` says why at length), and
     * it would be wrong in exactly the place it is dearest — a branch read, a
     * rotated cast. One IPC per open project per announce, and announces are
     * landings and imports rather than keystrokes.
     *
     * THE FIRST ANSWER FOR A PROJECT IS A BASELINE AND MOVES NOTHING, which is
     * the position effect's own first-sighting rule said about the document
     * instead of the picture: a window that has just met a project has no
     * difference to act on.
     *
     * A BASELINE IS NOT A NO-OP ANY MORE, THOUGH — see the position effect above,
     * which now asks for the document at a position it is meeting for the first
     * time instead of leaving it unknown until something announces.

   * it was: `Tab.path` is fixed when a document is opened from the documents panel
   * and nothing else ever moved it. So a project holding the scan and the reprint
   * made from its reading showed one of them however many rows were clicked —
   * *"switching between steps doesnt switch between the original pdf and the
   * rendered facsimile like i expected"* — and when there was nothing this could
   * change it put a sentence on the strip instead, which is the half the user was
   * angrier about: *"i wanted the document to show. instead of showing the
   * document, it gave me an error saying it couldnt show the document… it should be
   * showing me document"*.

   *
   * NO OUTLINES (the import, and any position with no reading above it): the
   * viewer comes out of the block editor. Nothing had been read at that point in
   * the book's story, so boxes drawn there would be the viewer making a claim
   * about a step the user is standing BEFORE — which is the one thing the revert
   * row exists to let somebody look at without.
   *
   * OUTLINES, VIEWER NOT IN THE MODE: it goes into the mode and reads the bank.
   * The expensive one, and it is expensive exactly once per genuinely different
   * picture.
   *
   * OUTLINES, VIEWER ALREADY IN THE MODE: the bank is re-read if the READING moved,
   * or if the pages under it changed — a document swap is a different PDF, and
   * boxes measured against the old one would be drawn over the new one's pages.

   * the app used to describe back at the user — their book was open, nothing was
   * showing it, and they were told to go and click it in the list. Doing it for
   * them is the whole of the fix.
   *
   * A PDF THIS PROJECT ALREADY HAS A TAB FOR: the tab MOVES to the new file. One
   * document per project in the viewer is what makes "the viewer shows the step"
   * true; opening the scan beside the reprint would leave two tabs with the same
   * book's name in the list and neither of them following the pointer.
   * `app-pdf-view` watches `tab.path` and re-opens when the string changes, so the
   * swap is the patch and nothing else — the same mechanism `relocate` uses when
   * an import moves a tab onto the project's copy.
   *
   * ANYTHING ELSE: opened, through the one door every open in this app goes
   * through. That covers a translation's EPUB, which is emphatically NOT swapped
   * into a PDF tab — a book is UNPACKED, and patching a path would leave a viewer
   * serving chapters out of a tree belonging to a different book — and it covers a
   * project whose document nobody has open. `adopt` refuses to make a second tab
   * for a file already open, so this cannot double up.
   *
   * ── Which tab follows the pointer, when the project has several ─────────────
   *
   * The one ON SCREEN first, then any at all — and ONLY of the kind the target
   * is. A person who has both the scan and the cast EPUB open has two tabs of one
   * project, and swapping the EPUB's tab to a PDF because they clicked a read row
   * would take away the book they were reading to answer a question about the
   * pages.
   *
   * ── AND A CHANGE OF KIND IS AN OPEN, NEVER A PATCH ──────────────────────────
   *
   * The position's document can now change KIND under a click: the import row
   * answers the scan and the read and curate rows answer the EPUB cast from the
   * reading (docs/WORKBENCH.md §4, Unit E). Patching a path across that boundary
   * would leave a PDF viewer pointed at a book — or an unpacked book's viewer
   * serving chapters out of a tree belonging to a scan — so the two documents stay
   * TWO TABS, and clicking between the steps swaps which of them the viewer holds.
   * That is why the flat list has to be able to hold both faces of one book at
   * once: nothing threads "this is a PDF" through the renderer, the seam is
   * position → document → show it (DERIVED-BOOK §7), and keeping both tabs is what
   * lets the viewer show whichever face the position names without throwing the
   * other away.
   *
   * The same-kind swap SURVIVES for PDF↔PDF, and it is worth keeping for the one
   * thing it does that opening cannot: `app-pdf-view` keeps the page you were on
   * when the path under it moves, and a scan re-opened as a second tab would land
   * you back at page one of a five-hundred-page book.

   * the library, still one click off. So the correction ADDS the surface the
   * position names and never removes the one that was asked for.
   *
   * `positionView.sheet` is the same test `showPosition` asks (read, edit, curate,

   *
   * Opening a project put the ORIGINAL document in the viewer while the position
   * stood on the newest step — an edit row, whose picture is the proof sheet —

   *
   * ── Why the original still opens first ──────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * The `openPath` round trip is where main records the recent — the fact Home
   * orders its rows by — and the adopted tab is the project's document face,
   * grouped in the documents nav where flipping to it is one click. So the
   * original opens exactly as it always has, and then, WHERE THE POSITION'S
   * PICTURE IS THE SHEET, the book tab goes on top: the same end state the user
   * was building by hand, in one click.

   * position effect's first sighting, because every other door into a project —
   * a drop, File→Open, a click in the documents panel, the host's deep link —
   * owed the same correction and none of them had a project directory to write it
   * against. What this method still owes is the REFRESH: the effect has no picture
   * to obey until somebody has read the history, and a project opened from Home
   * has usually never been seen by this window's ledger mirror.
   *
   * A project standing on the import keeps today's behaviour: the position's
   * surface IS the document, and `view.sheet` is false there for a scan. An
   * imported EPUB's origin row answers sheet=true (positionView owns that test),

   * "the PDF" means in every other sentence this app says. The tab kept the
   * outside path, because the import is deliberately not awaited and there was
   * nothing else to name at the moment the tab was made.
   *
   * Everything then asked the wrong question. `projectFor(tab.path)` answers
   * null for a path outside the library, so Generate said a book that had just
   * been read had not been read, the dock's waiting light stayed lit on a
   * finished project, the nav could not group the document under its own book,
   * and the block editor had no bank to fetch. One stale string, six broken
   * features, and nothing on screen to explain any of it.
   *
   * ── The same tab, never a second one ────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * `adopt` would make a new tab for the new path, which is exactly the failure
   * this exists to prevent: two viewers onto one document, two scroll positions,
   * and the user watching their book apparently open twice. So this PATCHES —
   * the tab keeps its id, its ledger, its selection and its place in the list,
   * and only its idea of where the file is changes.
   *
   * A PDF viewer reloads by itself: `app-pdf-view` watches `tab.path` through a
   * computed and re-opens when the string changes, which is a repaint of the
   * same pages from the same bytes. A book does not reload at all — it is
   * already unpacked, and it is unpacked from the SAME project, because the
   * import is keyed by the file's content and both paths reach it.
   *
   * `savedPath` MOVES WITH IT WHEN IT NAMED THE FILE WE ARE LEAVING. It is a
   * grant — for a book opened from the user's own disk it names their file, and
   * Save updating the copy they chose is what they asked for by opening it — but
   * that stops being true the moment the tab stops showing that file. A Save
   * that repacked the working tree over a document on another drive, while every
   * label on screen said the library's copy, is the same invariant `meta:write-pdf`
   * broke: THE APP NEVER SILENTLY WRITES OUTSIDE ITS LIBRARY. Main revokes the
   * matching grant in the same breath. Where `savedPath` names something else

   *
   * This used to ask whenever a tab was `unsaved`, and `unsaved` means "no copy
   * of this exists anywhere you chose" — which is true FROM BIRTH of every book
   * this app opens out of a project, because the project IS where it lives. So
   * closing a tab somebody had done nothing but look at raised a dialog about a
   * loss that had not happened, and a warning that fires when nothing is at stake
   * is how a person learns to dismiss the one that matters. The user ruled on it
   * in a sentence: *"only pop up a confirmation alert if changes have been
   * made."*
   *
   * It is also a warning that outlived its workflow. It was written when Save put
   * a copy somewhere of the user's choosing and the app could reasonably say "you
   * have not done that yet"; saving is the export modal's job now
   * (docs/WORKBENCH.md §6), a project tab that closes loses track of nothing, and
   * Home still lists the book. The DOT stays — `Tab.unsaved` is a fact worth
   * drawing — but it is not a reason to stop somebody on their way out.
   *
   * ── ONE QUESTION FOR TWO LOSSES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * A book's filed copy can be out of date, and a scan's corrections can have no
   * save to come back to. Main composes whichever of the two are true into one
   * card, because this codebase has already ruled that a closing document is
   * asked about once (`closeShowing`): a second dialog on top of the first is the
   * app arguing with an answer it already has.
   *
   * ── And the offer to keep the work is a button, not advice ─────────────────
   *
   * A dialog whose only route to keeping the work is *cancel, hunt for Apply,
   * close again* has made the user do the app's job, and the way that ends is
   * that they stop reading the box. So the answer can be "apply these changes,
   * then close" — and it goes through the viewer's own `apply`, the same path the
   * sheet's own button takes, rather than a second commit written for this
   * dialog. AN APPLY MAIN REFUSES LEAVES THE TAB OPEN: closing anyway would have
   * thrown away the very thing the answer asked to keep, and main's own sentence
   * is already in the notice strip saying why it would not land.
