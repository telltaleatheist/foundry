/**
 * The open documents — the flat list, and the one place that knows which is
 * which.
 *
 * TABS ARE RENDERER STATE, on purpose. Main owns everything with a lifetime — a
 * conversion, an unpacked book's temp directory, the allow-list — but which of
 * them is open and in what order is a window's own business, and pushing that
 * through IPC would make a reload of the renderer able to disturb it.
 *
 * The one door in is `document:opened`. The menu, the dialog, a drop, a path on
 * argv and a conversion that just finished all reach main first (which decides
 * whether the file is openable at all) and arrive back here as that event. So
 * this service never has to decide whether a path is real, and there is exactly
 * one code path that creates a tab.
 *
 * ── This was `TabsService`, and this file is four fifths of what it did ──────
 *
 * `TabsService` was 2,752 lines and about fourteen injection sites, and unit 8c
 * (docs/PLAN.md §4) broke it along the seams it had grown rather than the ones it
 * was designed with. What stayed here is the LIST AND ITS LIFE: identity, naming,
 * the flags a document wears, the doors it is opened by and the questions it is
 * closed by. What left is what was never about a list — the notice sentence
 * (`NoticeService`), what is on screen (`StageService`), the ledger's opinion
 * about what ought to be (`PositionSyncService`) and the book viewers' undo
 * stacks (`BookStacksService`).
 *
 * THE DEPENDENCY RUNS ONE WAY and it is the whole point: Notice ← Documents ←
 * Stage ← PositionSync. This file may say a sentence and may ask a book viewer
 * what a close would scrap; it may not ask what is on screen, and does not need
 * to — see `show` below for the one place that looked like it did.
 *
 * ── ONE VIEWER, AND THE SECOND REVERSAL THIS CLASS CARRIED ──────────────────
 *
 * The class this came out of carried the record of the panes: one to five columns
 * side by side, and the reversal that brought each column's CHROME-STYLE STRIP
 * back with pin, drag-split and close. Both went on one ruling (2026-08-17):
 *
 *   *"i dont think we should have tabs in foundry. i think its making things a
 *   bit confusing. however, the user should be able to compare two steps
 *   sometimes. so i think the solution is to have a single viewer window/single
 *   tab, and if the user wants to compare two steps, theres a compare button
 *   they can click and then they can choose the step to compare."*
 *
 * THE TABS STAY IN ONE FLAT LIST, and now it is the only list there is. It was
 * already flat under the panes, on the rule that `patch()` — the one function
 * every edit, save and flag in this file goes through — must never have to search
 * a list of lists. What went with the columns is the second structure that held
 * ids INTO it; the order in the list is the library panel's, through `reorder`,
 * and nothing else records a sequence.
 *
 * A DOCUMENT HAS AT MOST ONE TAB, unchanged and load-bearing. Opening something
 * already open SHOWS it rather than putting a second viewer over one unpack —
 * the rule `adopt()` has always enforced for files.
 *
 * ── TWO KINDS, WHICH IS WHERE R6c LEFT IT ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There were four. `epub` was an unpacked book served to a sandboxed <iframe>
 * and `editor` was that book's markup in a textarea beside it, and both are
 * deleted with the editing world they belonged to (docs/RENDERER.md §7). What is
 * left is a document this app SHOWS and a book this app EDITS.
 */

/**
 * `book` IS THE ONE KIND THAT IS NOT A FILE.
 *
 * `pdf` is a document on disk — a scan or a facsimile, shown and never edited
 * (docs/RENDERER.md §0 A1). A `book` tab is the project's BOOK — the reflowed
 * blocks the renderer draws on the proof sheet (docs/RENDERER.md §5) — which does
 * not live in any one file the user opens: it is made from the bank at the
 * position, main decides which bank that is, and the renderer never learns where
 * it is kept. So the tab carries the PROJECT DIRECTORY in `path` and asks main
 * for the rows by naming it.
 *
 * That is why `projectDirOf` has a case for this kind and nothing else does: for
 * every other tab the project is the folder the file is IN, and for this one the
 * path IS the project.
 *
 * ── AND `pages` IS THE THIRD THING THAT IS NOT A FILE EITHER ───────────────
 *
 * A captured book is a FOLDER of rectified page images: the mint writes them and
 * files no document, because Owen ruled the container out (*"i agree that this
 * doesnt need to be a pdf"*, `recordMint`). So the one thing a `pdf` tab is for
 * — a path pdf.js can be handed — does not exist for it, and pointing this app's
 * one PDF viewer at a directory is how the app came to tell somebody their pages
 * were no longer there while they sat on the disk.
 *
 * It carries the PROJECT DIRECTORY for the book tab's reason and not merely by
 * analogy: a project can hold two mints, standing on either row is how you look
 * at that one, and a tab that named a mint's own folder would be a second tab
 * every time somebody re-minted. One tab per project, contents decided by the
 * position, re-asked on every move — the book tab's whole shape, over pictures
 * instead of blocks.
 */
export type TabKind = 'pdf' | 'book' | 'capture' | 'pages';

/**
 * WHETHER THIS TAB'S `path` IS A DIRECTORY RATHER THAN A FILE.
 *
 * Named because it is the question seven sites were asking and none of them
 * said so: they tested `kind === 'book'` and MEANT "the path is a project, so
 * do not treat it as bytes". Adding `capture` as a third kind made every one of
 * those seven silently wrong — the same defaulting-switch shape the capture
 * feature has now met four times in one evening, most recently as seven
 * predicates branching on a step's action.
 *
 * So the property gets a name and the sites ask for the property. A fourth kind
 * whose path is a directory joins by being added HERE, and a fourth kind whose
 * path is a file changes nothing — which is the difference between a decision
 * recorded once and a decision re-taken correctly seven times.
 *
 * The three directory kinds are otherwise nothing alike: a `book` tab is a
 * reading of a finished book, a `capture` tab is a light table of photographs
 * that are not a book yet, and a `pages` tab is the book a mint made, drawn as
 * the pictures it is. They share a filesystem fact, not a nature, and every site
 * that cares about the nature still asks about the kind.
 *
 * THE FOURTH KIND JOINED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE, which is this function's own
 * promise being kept rather than a coincidence. `pages` was added to the union
 * above and to this line, and the seven sites that ask "is the path a directory"
 * were correct for it before anybody looked at them.
 *
 * IT IS A TYPE PREDICATE and that is not decoration: the sites it replaces were
 * narrowing `kind` by testing it, and one of them passes the narrowed kind to a
 * function that only accepts `pdf`. A plain boolean compiled everywhere except
 * there, where it failed loudly — which is the behaviour worth having.

   *
   * So the RAW WRITE lives here, where the doors are, and the stage owns

     * ONE QUESTION, ONE ANSWER, AND THE BRANCH THAT USED TO BE HERE WAS A BUG.
     *
     * ── Owen's report ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * *"when i export an epub and then click on it in foundry, the narrate
     * button disappears, but a narrate button appears inside the epub's worktree
     * item. i dont care if theres a narrate button on the epub in the worktree
     * but the narrate button should not disappear if the user clicks epub.
     * thats the exact opposite behavior of what it should be."*
     *
     * ── Why it disappeared, which is not where anybody was looking ───────────
     *
     * This used to ask `pathIsProject` first and, for a book tab, look the path
     * up as a project DIRECTORY by exact match. That is true of the tab
     * `bookTabIn` makes, whose path IS a project. IT IS FALSE OF THE ONE
     * `openExportView` MAKES: that is also `kind: 'book'`, and its path is an
     * EPUB FILE in `final/`. So the exact-directory lookup found nothing, this
     * returned null, and `ActionMenu.hostReady` — which asks only whether the
     * project can run a host act — had no project to ask about.
     *
     * So it was never Narrate that vanished. EVERY host act vanished at once,
     * because the window had stopped being able to say which book was in front
     * of it. The tree's export row kept its button because that path asks what
     * the ROW produces (`produces: 'export'`) and never comes through here,
     * which is exactly the inversion Owen described: the button left the place
     * that had lost the project and stayed in the place that had not.
     *
     * ── The fix is a deletion, and it is provably not a change ───────────────
     *
     * `projectFor` already answers both shapes in one comparison — it tests
     * `target === dir || target.startsWith(dir + '/')`, and its own docblock
     * argues the equality case at length ("THE DIRECTORY ITSELF IS IN ITS OWN
     * PROJECT"), added when the proof sheet hit this same class from the other
     * side. So the branch was asking a narrower version of a question the
     * fallback already answered correctly, and removing it gives the identical
     * answer for every tab whose path IS a project and a right answer for the
     * one whose path is not.
     *
     * ── What is still true, and is somebody else's to fix ───────────────────
     *
     * `pathIsProject` STILL CLAIMS THAT EVERY BOOK TAB'S PATH IS A DIRECTORY,
     * and that claim is false for an export view. It is not repaired here
     * because it is a type predicate seven other sites narrow on, and this
     * defect needed one of them corrected rather than seven audited at speed.
     * The honest discriminator is already on the tab: `viewOnly` is set in
     * exactly one place, `openExportView`, and means precisely "this book tab is
     * a finished file rather than a project".

   * The `openPath` round trip is where main records the recent — the fact Home

   * REFRESH: that effect has no picture to obey until somebody has read the
   * history, and a project opened from Home has usually never been seen by this
   * window's ledger mirror.
   *
   * A project standing on the import keeps today's behaviour: the position's
   * surface IS the document, and `view.sheet` is false there for a scan. An

   *
   * The tab names the project and the POSITION decides which mint's pages it

   * IT DOES NOT REPLACE THE LIGHT TABLE and must never be made to. The photographs
   * and their recipe stay editable after a mint — that is what makes a re-mint

   * "the PDF" means in every other sentence this app says. The tab kept the
   * outside path, because the import is deliberately not awaited and there was
   * nothing else to name at the moment the tab was made.
   *
   * Everything then asked the wrong question. `projectFor(tab.path)` answers
   * null for a path outside the library, so Generate said a book that had just
   * been read had not been read, the dock's waiting light stayed lit on a
   * finished project, the nav could not group the document under its own book,
   * and the block editor had no bank to fetch. One stale string, six broken
   * features, and nothing on screen to explain any of it.
   *
   * ── The same tab, never a second one ────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * `adopt` would make a new tab for the new path, which is exactly the failure
   * this exists to prevent: two viewers onto one document, two scroll positions,
   * and the user watching their book apparently open twice. So this PATCHES —
   * the tab keeps its id, its ledger, its selection and its place in the list,
   * and only its idea of where the file is changes.
   *
   * A PDF viewer reloads by itself: `app-pdf-view` watches `tab.path` through a
   * computed and re-opens when the string changes, which is a repaint of the
   * same pages from the same bytes. A book does not reload at all — it is
   * already unpacked, and it is unpacked from the SAME project, because the
   * import is keyed by the file's content and both paths reach it.
   *
   * `savedPath` MOVES WITH IT WHEN IT NAMED THE FILE WE ARE LEAVING. It is a
   * grant — for a book opened from the user's own disk it names their file, and
   * Save updating the copy they chose is what they asked for by opening it — but
   * that stops being true the moment the tab stops showing that file. A Save
   * that repacked the working tree over a document on another drive, while every
   * label on screen said the library's copy, is the same invariant `meta:write-pdf`
   * broke: THE APP NEVER SILENTLY WRITES OUTSIDE ITS LIBRARY. Main revokes the

   * ── THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED ABOUT NOTHING ───────────────────────────────
   *
   * This used to ask whenever a tab was `unsaved`, and `unsaved` means "no copy
   * of this exists anywhere you chose" — which is true FROM BIRTH of every book
   * this app opens out of a project, because the project IS where it lives. So
   * closing a tab somebody had done nothing but look at raised a dialog about a
   * loss that had not happened, and a warning that fires when nothing is at stake
   * is how a person learns to dismiss the one that matters. The user ruled on it
   * in a sentence: *"only pop up a confirmation alert if changes have been
   * made."*
   *
   * It is also a warning that outlived its workflow. It was written when Save put
   * a copy somewhere of the user's choosing and the app could reasonably say "you
   * have not done that yet"; saving is the export modal's job now
   * (docs/WORKBENCH.md §6), a project tab that closes loses track of nothing, and
   * Home still lists the book. The DOT stays — `Tab.unsaved` is a fact worth
   * drawing — but it is not a reason to stop somebody on their way out.
   *
   * ── ONE QUESTION FOR TWO STATES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * A book's filed copy can be out of date, and a book pane can hold changes
   * nobody applied. Main composes whichever of the two are true into one card,
   * because this codebase has already ruled that a closing document is asked
   * about once (`closeShowing`): a second dialog on top of the first is the app
   * arguing with an answer it already has.
   *
   * IT SAID "TWO LOSSES" UNTIL 2026-08-22, and the second one has stopped being
   * a loss — see the scrap-guard below for Owen's reversal and what the card asks
   * now.
   *
   * ── And the offer to keep the work is a button, not advice ─────────────────
   *
   * A dialog whose only route to keeping the work is *cancel, hunt for Apply,
   * close again* has made the user do the app's job, and the way that ends is
   * that they stop reading the box. So the answer can be "apply these changes,
   * then close" — and it goes through the viewer's own `apply`, the same path the
   * sheet's own button takes, rather than a second commit written for this
   * dialog. AN APPLY MAIN REFUSES LEAVES THE TAB OPEN: closing anyway would have

     * was already on disk and what ended was a way back. The book viewer's stack

     * without applying scraps it").
     *
     * OWEN REVERSED THAT RULING ON 2026-08-22, after a real project lost real
     * work to it: the stack is written to a sidecar as it is made
     * (`BookStacksService.rememberPending`) and comes back the next time the book
     * is opened at the same step. So closing costs nothing by itself, and this
     * card is no longer a warning — it is the offer to RECORD the work as a step,
     * which matters because everything made from this book (an export, a
