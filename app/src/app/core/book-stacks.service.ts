/**
 * THE BOOK VIEWER'S STACK, as everything outside that viewer needs it.
 *
 * ── Why a wire exists at all, when the selection deliberately has none ──────
 *
 * The book viewer keeps its selection to itself on a stated rule: surface-local
 * state stays local until something else genuinely needs it, and a wire with
 * nothing on either end is worse than no wire. The stack is the case where
 * something else does need it, and TWO things do.
 *
 * THE UNDO CHORD IS ROUTED, not listened for. Ctrl+Z is a menu accelerator that
 * main swallows on its way past, and the renderer decides which of the undos a
 * chord meant — a text box's, or the book's (`MenuAction`, shared/api.ts).
 * `replay` is where that decision is made, and a global key listener added by the
 * viewer would be a second answer fighting the first.
 *
 * AND CLOSING IS ASKED ABOUT IN ONE PLACE. `questionBefore` (OpenDocumentsService)
 * is the one dialog a closing tab gets, on this codebase's own ruling that a
 * person shutting a book is asked once about everything it costs. That question
 * has to be able to see the stack — and, because a card whose only route to
 * keeping the work is *cancel, find Apply, close again* has made the user do the
 * app's job, it has to be able to press Apply too.
 *
 * WHAT THAT QUESTION IS ABOUT CHANGED ON 2026-08-22. It used to report a real
 * destruction: the stack was memory and nothing else, and "Apply writes and
 * clears; closing without applying scraps it" was the ruling (docs/RENDERER.md
 * §3). A real project then lost real work to exactly that — the pane's changes
 * were never applied, an export came out silently without them, and the stack
 * went with a window that closed without the card ever being drawn — and Owen
 * reversed it: unapplied work is never silently scrapped. The stack is written to
 * a sidecar as it is made (the bottom half of this file) and put back the next
 * time the book is opened at the same step, so the card now asks whether to
 * RECORD the work, and only its own Discard throws anything away.
 *
 * IT IS AN INTERFACE THE VIEWER IMPLEMENTS rather than state this service holds,
 * which is the whole of what keeps the ruling intact: the ops still live in the
 * component that makes them, and what crosses the boundary is a set of questions
 * and a set of verbs.
 *
 * ── AND NOW THE PANELS, WHICH IS WHY IT GREW ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Notes, Furniture review and Chapters live in the app shell and keep its dark
 * style (RENDERER-DESIGN.md §5), which puts them OUTSIDE the viewer whose stack
 * their every gesture pushes onto. A panel that kept its own list of notes would
 * be a second account of the book — the exact failure the replay exists to make
 * impossible — so what crosses here is the viewer's OWN replay, read as a signal,
 * and one verb that puts ops on the viewer's own stack. Undo, redo and Apply then
 * take a panel's decision back exactly as they take a decision made on the paper,
 * because there is one stack and it is the viewer's.
 *
 * THE SELECTION CROSSED WITH THEM, and it crossed as a QUESTION rather than as
 * state. The viewer's own rule was that its selection stays local *until something
 * else genuinely needs it* — "the day the inspector can act on it, it moves up".
 * That day is this one: "a chapter starts at the selected block" is a panel
 * button about a block picked on the paper. It is still the viewer's signal, still
 * in no undo stack and still gone on a reload; the panel reads it and cannot
 * write it.

 * is the piece with the cleanest edge of the five: it knows about a MAP KEYED BY
 * TAB ID and about nothing else in the window. No list, no pointer, no position,
 * no opening or closing. That is why it may be depended on by the documents
 * service — the closing question has to be able to count what a close would scrap
 * — without that dependency ever running back the other way.
 *
 * IT DEPENDS ON THE NOTICE AND NOTHING ELSE. `Tab` arrives as a TYPE (erased at
 * emit, so no module cycle with the service that owns it) and the tab itself
 * arrives as an ARGUMENT: `undo`/`redo` are handed the document in front of the
 * user by whoever raised the chord, because "what is on screen" is the stage's
 * question and asking it here would be this service reaching up the chain it sits
 * at the bottom of.

   * Because "what would be lost" and "land it" were being answered in two places

   * stack and pressed Apply for it (`questionBefore`, core/documents.service.ts);
   * the make-act gate needed the identical count and the identical press before

   * a dialog comes to disagree with the button that opened it. So the pair moved
   * HERE, where both halves of the answer already live — the live viewer's stack
   * and the parked one — and adopting the history main hands back is the one
   * thing that press cannot do without.
   *
   * IT DOES NOT WIDEN THE EDGE THIS CLASS DEFENDS. The map is still keyed by tab
   * id and this service still knows nothing about which document is on screen,
