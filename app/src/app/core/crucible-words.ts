/**
 * THE WORDS. Every sentence a person reads about a Crucible's stock is composed
 * here, and nothing in `electron/` or `shared/` composes one.
 *
 * ── Why the code and the copy disagree on purpose ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The code says `server`, `job type`, `subject`, `task`, `module` because those
 * are the contract's names and a file that renamed them would be describing a
 * system nobody else can talk about. A person reading the app has no use for
 * any of them: they have a **GPU engine**, it **prepares** things, and it is
 * **ready** or it is **busy**. So the translation lives in exactly one file,
 * the renderer's, and the wire (`shared/coordinate-wire.ts`) carries facts
 * rather than sentences (crucible ARCHITECTURE.md R1 — one owner, and the owner
 * of the wording is the screen).
 *
 * The four rules, from the brief of 2026-09-14, and they are BookForge's
 * verbatim because the two apps talk to the same machines and must not tell one
 * person two stories about one of them:
 *
 *   1. **GPU engine (Crucible)** on first mention in a panel, **engine** after.
 *      The Settings section keeps the title "Servers", because that is what
 *      somebody is looking for when they know the word already.
 *   2. The pairing line is a **connect code** — "Show connect code", "Paste a
 *      connect code". Nobody has ever called a URL with a fragment a "pairing
 *      line" except this contract.
 *   3. "Open Crucible" is **Open engine console**.
 *   4. **Job types, subjects, tasks and modules never appear.** What is being
 *      prepared is said in a person's words, and the names come from the
 *      catalog rows the server itself returns ({@link subjectWords}).

 *
 * Foundry's module (`shared/foundry.module.json`) names exactly one job type,
 * `llm`. The other rows are BookForge's and are kept here on purpose: a shared
 * server may report any of them back through a module task's `reload` step, and
 * a row that printed a bare `tts` at somebody would be this app's vocabulary
 * leaking through the one file whose job is to stop it.
