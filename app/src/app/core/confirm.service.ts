/**
 * EVERY QUESTION THIS APP ASKS, ASKED IN THIS APP.
 *
 * ── What it replaced, and what the OS chrome was costing ────────────────────
 *
 * There were six native message boxes: the delete confirmation, the closing
 * document, the unlinked footnote, the re-read, and the two echoes between a
 * page heading and its contents entry. `dialog.showMessageBox` is modal to the
 * WINDOW — the next gesture cannot race it, and it cannot scroll out from under
 * itself — and that is a real advantage this card had to earn back. What it
 * could not do is look like this app: it is the OS's rectangle, in the OS's
 * fonts, with the OS's button order, and a program whose every other question is
 * a card in its own idiom asking these through a system alert reads as a program
 * interrupted by something else. The user called the first one "the js alert",
 * and then ruled on the rest of them: *"we should have zero js alerts. they
 * should all be custom modals."*
 *
 * The modality is earned the way the app earns it everywhere else — a fixed
 * full-window scrim at the top of the stack, which takes every click before
 * anything under it can, including a sandboxed iframe that is free to scroll
 * behind it.
 *
 * ── THE FACTS ARE STILL MAIN'S ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing in this file composes a sentence. `AppQuestion` and `DeletionPrompt`
 * arrive whole from the process that knows the size on disk, the readings bank's
 * page count and what a save is worth (electron/main.ts). The one thing the
 * renderer must never do to this dialog is start writing its own copy, which is
 * how a warning worth reading becomes "Are you sure?".
 *
 * ── A PROMISE, so a caller reads as the sentence it is ──────────────────────
 *
 *     if (!await this.confirm.ask(prompt)) return;
 *
 * ── IT DRAWS OVER ANOTHER DIALOG AND DOES NOT CLOSE IT ──────────────────────
 *
 * `UiService.dialogs` is one-at-a-time in one direction only, and the direction
 * matters. Any other dialog opening closes this one — the effect below turns
 * that into the question's own dismissal answer, so a promise nobody will ever
 * settle cannot leave a caller holding a lock forever. But this one opening
 * closes NOTHING: a confirmation is a question ABOUT the gesture that raised it,
 * and the re-read question is raised from inside the OCR card by the very button
 * that would enqueue the run. Taking that card away to ask about it would answer
 * a question nobody asked — the person says "no, leave the reading as it is" and
 * finds the dialog they were filling in has gone. The card sits above every
 * other dialog (z-index, `ConfirmDialogComponent`), so drawing over one is
 * exactly as modal as replacing it and loses nothing.

     * change and must not have to know a card exists. What changed is where the
     * drawing happens, and the preload cannot reach an Angular component, so the
     * component's service reaches the preload instead.
     *
     * IN THE CONSTRUCTOR AND NOWHERE ELSE. `ConfirmDialogComponent` is mounted
     * for the whole life of the window and injects this, so the registration
     * happens at bootstrap, before any gesture can ask anything. There is no
     * unregister for the same reason: there is no moment where the right place
     * for one of these questions is somewhere else.
