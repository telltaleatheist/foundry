/**
 * Metadata — the record the DOCUMENT keeps about itself.
 *
 * The same shape as the OCR and Translate dialogs, and one important difference:
 * those two configure a job and hand it to the queue, while this one reads and
 * writes a file directly. It is still an engine command — `foundry epub-meta`
 * and `foundry pdf-meta`, spawned by main and answered as JSON on stdout — but
 * it finishes in milliseconds, so there is nothing to queue and nothing to
 * watch.
 *
 * FILENAMES DO NOT FOLLOW THE TITLE, and this is the comment for whoever comes
 * along later and thinks that looks like an oversight. `project.json` holds
 * `title` and `stem` as two fields precisely so that a book's NAME and its
 * FILENAMES are decoupled by construction. Correcting a title changes the
 * metadata and moves nothing: those paths are in the user's recents, in
 * whatever else they have pointed at them, and in a sync client's index, and a
 * settings-shaped gesture that quietly renamed a 20 MB file in three places is
 * not a thing this app does behind somebody's back. "Rename the files to match"
 * can exist later as its own deliberate action, with its own button.
 *
 * WHAT IS EDITED IS THE WORKING COPY. For an EPUB that is the unpacked working
 * tree — the same tree every cut and every word edit writes to — so the change
 * is durable at once and Save packs it with everything else. For a PDF it is
 * the working PDF, which the engine rewrites whole; `archive/` still holds the
 * file that came in, byte for byte, which is what makes that acceptable.
 *
 * ONLY WHAT CHANGED IS SENT. A field the user did not touch is not in the patch
 * and is not on the engine's command line, so it is not re-spliced, not
 * renormalised, and not turned into a refusal about blank values by a box that
 * happened to be empty.

   * `generated/` copies of one book at once.

   * document of its own or has not resolved one yet (a project nothing has read a

   * a document that is plainly on screen, which is the app refusing to do
