/**
 * THE EDITOR AS A ROOM YOU STEP INTO: this photograph, then the rest of the book.
 *
 * ── Why a modal and not a pane ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Wave 21 point 1, from Owen's own reading of PDFElement: the grid is where you
 * choose, and the editor is where you work. The editor used to REPLACE the grid
 * inside the same tab, so leaving it meant a button called "All photographs" and
 * coming back meant finding your card again. A modal keeps the table underneath,
 * which is the difference between going somewhere and opening something.
 *
 * ── THE TWO LEVELS ARE THE TWO GROUPS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE STRUCTURE ──────
 *
 * Wave 24. The controls that change THIS PHOTOGRAPH are in one group and the
 * controls that change THE BOOK are in another, each under a heading that says
 * so. Both levels have existed since Wave 21 and the app never said which was
 * which -- the rail was the book, this column was the page, and the buttons
 * shape-shifted between the two. Owen: *"the two buttons at the bottom are
 * confusing as hell… the whole paradigm of how we're doing it now versus
 * global+individual"*.
 *
 * Two things went to make that legible. THE TOOL SELECTOR, because Turn, Crop
 * and Split were modes over a picture whose corners and gutter stayed draggable
 * in all three -- so a mode changed no gesture, only which buttons were on
 * screen. And THE STAGES: a derived stage 1 / stage 2 that decided whether the
 * primary button set the whole shoot or one page. There is one control set now
 * and it does not change, which is what lets every control be named after its
 * outcome instead of after the state it is in.
 *
 * What holds the surface together instead is one rule, and it is this stage's
 * own precedent (from the split button: *"not a disabled button but an ABSENT
 * one"*):
 *
 *     A CONTROL THAT WOULD CHANGE NOTHING IS NOT SHOWN.
 *
 * ── What it does NOT own ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The corners, the split line and the previews are still
 * `CapturePageEditorComponent`, unchanged and still pointable at any image. What
 * lives up here is the ACTS -- because those are decisions about the shoot, and
 * the picture below is one photograph.

          They have both existed since Wave 21 and the app never said so: the

          THE TOOL SELECTOR IS GONE, and that is the structural change. Turn,
          Crop and Split were three exclusive MODES over one picture whose
          corners and gutter were draggable in all three -- so the mode never
          changed what a gesture did, only which buttons were on screen, which is
          a mode you cannot see the effect of. Every control it used to hide is
          here at once, governed by one rule instead:

            A CONTROL THAT WOULD CHANGE NOTHING IS NOT SHOWN.

          Which is this stage's own precedent, from the split button: *"not a
          disabled button but an ABSENT one"*. A photograph that matches the rest
          therefore carries almost nothing -- just the picture and its handles.

            TICKING IS THE CUT. There is no place it out and confirm it later,
