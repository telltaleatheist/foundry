/**
 * ONE PAGE ON THE LIGHT TABLE.
 *
 * A thumbnail, what it is called, and whether it has been struck. It holds no
 * state and reaches nothing: the grid owns the order and the service owns the
 * recipe, so a card is a picture with two things it can say — "open me" and
 * "strike me".
 *
 * ── IT DRAWS THE CROP, BECAUSE OTHERWISE NOTHING SHOWS ─────────────────────
 *
 * The card used to be the raw thumbnail and nothing else, so a photograph that
 * had been turned and cropped looked identical to one nobody had touched. Owen
 * ran apply-to-all across twenty-five photographs, it worked, and he reported
 * it as "didnt work... there was no indicator" -- which is the correct reading
 * of a grid that shows the same picture before and after.
 *
 * So the quad is drawn over the thumbnail: the outline of the page that will be
 * minted, and a mark on the corner that becomes its TOP-LEFT. The mark is what
 * makes a turn visible at all -- a quarter turn permutes the corner assignment
 * without moving any of them, so the outline alone is identical before and
 * after and only the mark moves.
 *
 * It is an overlay in the thumbnail's own fraction space (viewBox 0 0 1 1),
 * exactly as the editor's handles are, so nothing here measures pixels and the
 * card can be any size.
 *
 * ── A STRUCK CARD STAYS ON THE TABLE ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * docs/CAPTURE.md: a struck page "stays visible on the grid the way struck rows
 * stay visible on the workbench, and is excluded from the mint". So striking is
 * drawn rather than subtracted — the card dims and says so, and the person can
 * see the retake they rejected sitting next to the one they kept. A card that
 * vanished would leave a hole in the spread order that nothing explains, and
 * unstriking would be a thing you could only do by remembering it was there.

        THE CARD DRAWS THE PHOTOGRAPH THE WAY ROUND IT WILL PRINT.

        Owen turned twenty-five spreads upright, went back to the table, and the
        table looked exactly as it had -- so he reported that the turn had not
        stuck. It had: every one of them is turned in the file. The only sign
        the grid gave was the dot below, four hundredths of a card wide, and
        that dot had been added the LAST time he reported this same class.

        THE PICTURE AND ITS OUTLINE TURN AS ONE ELEMENT, which is not a
        convenience. The crop is drawn in the thumbnail's own fraction space, so
        anything that turns one without the other puts a sideways crop over a
        correctly turned photograph -- worse than no indicator, because it reads
        as a bug in the crop rather than as an absence.

     *
     * Owen dropped twenty-seven photographs and got twenty-seven cards that
     * were nothing but their labels. Every upstream explanation was measured
     * and killed: the recipe carried 3024x4032 on all twenty-seven, the door
     * served, the JPEG decoded (naturalWidth 480), and aspect-ratio
     * computed to a VALID ratio rather than NaN. The box collapsed anyway --
     * and it collapsed to ZERO IN BOTH AXES, which is the fact that names the
     * cause. A ratio box that had merely lost its height would still have been
     * as wide as the card.
     *
     * This is a flex item in a column, so its width was coming from stretch
     * and its height from the ratio. But it has NO IN-FLOW CHILDREN -- the .spun span
     * is absolute -- so its content-based main size is zero, and a flex item
     * that resolves a cross size from its own aspect ratio does not then take
     * the stretch. Zero times the ratio is zero, and nothing underneath it
     * disagreed.
     *
     * So the width is STATED instead of inherited from an alignment. The card
     * is the containing block and the picture is as wide as the card, which is
     * what the design says out loud anyway; the ratio then resolves the height
     * from a width that is definite before it is asked for.
     *
     * WHY NO min-height FLOOR HERE: a floor was drafted for this bug and
     * would have been the wrong repair. A zero-WIDE box with a floor under its
     * height is still a box with no picture in it -- it would have turned a
     * card that is honestly broken into a card that looks deliberately empty.
     * The floor was for a missing NUMBER; this was a missing CONSTRAINT.
     *
     * AND WHY NO TEST GUARDS THIS: three separate harnesses reproduced this
     * component's markup and CSS with these exact numbers and all three drew
     * the card correctly, because each put the grid in normal flow where the
     * width is definite for a different reason. The defect lives in the
     * resolution, not the computation, and only the assembled app has it.
