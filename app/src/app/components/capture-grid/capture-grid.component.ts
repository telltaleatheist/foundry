 *
 * ── What this owns, and what it refuses to ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The arrangement: which card sits where, which way the sort runs, where a
 * dragged page lands, and where files may be dropped. It owns none of the
 * meaning — a card is a row of pixels and a label handed to it, the recipe is
 * the service's, and every gesture leaves here as an event rather than as a
 * mutation.
 *
 * That is what lets the grid be drawn against anything: it never learns what a
 * quad is, and the rules about spreads and splits live where they can be shared
 * (`capture-editor/geometry.ts`, and the service above it).
 *
 * ── A CLICK CHOOSES; OPENING TAKES TWO ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Wave 21 point 1. Until tonight a single click OPENED the editor, so the only
 * way to select one card was to draw a marquee band across it and stop -- and
 * selection is now the gesture the table is FOR: it feeds reorder, delete, and
 * which photograph the modal opens on. A gesture that common cannot cost a
 * rubber band.
 *
 * So a click chooses, ctrl and meta toggle, shift takes the run, and OPENING is
 * a double-click or Enter. The marquee is untouched and still starts anywhere
 * on the table, because at fifty-two cards almost every pixel is a card.
 *
 * The one number that moves between the two worlds is what "one selected" means
 * for Enter: PHOTOGRAPHS, not cards, through the same fold the menu and the
 * confirm use. Both halves of a split spread are two cards on one picture, and
 * the editor edits the picture.
 *
 * ── THE ORDER STOPS BEING A SORT THE MOMENT SOMEBODY DRAGS ──────────────────
 *
 * docs/CAPTURE.md: cards arrive "sorted by capture time … Cards drag to
 * reorder; once the user has dragged, the sort is history and their order is the
 * order." So this component emits a REORDER — the full list of ids in their new
 * arrangement — and never a "move card 3 to slot 7" that a re-sort could
 * silently undo. The service decides that the recipe's `order` is now the
 * person's and stops sorting.
 *
 * ── REVERSE IS ASKED FOR, NOT DONE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The doc's sharpest trap: "Reverse operates on capture order, not on split
 * halves. A book shot back-to-front reverses into reading order by spread;
 * within each split the left page still precedes the right. Reversing raw page
 * cards would silently swap every pair." A grid holding a flat list of cards
 * CANNOT honour that — it cannot see which two cards were one photograph. So it
 * emits `reverse` and the service, which holds the photos, does it properly.
 * Reversing the array here would be exactly the bug the doc names.
 *
 * ── The drop zone stops the drop, and that was NOT ENOUGH ───────────────────
 *
 * This zone calls `stopPropagation` so the window’s own file-drop handler does
 * not also answer a drop the grid has taken. That much was always right and it
 * still is. What it was NOT is sufficient, and Owen found out in the first
 * minutes of the acceptance run: the zone is a STRIP DOWN ONE SIDE, so a drop
 * on the table, on the empty state, or on the header sailed past it to the
 * window and came back as “IMG_0238.HEIC is not something Foundry opens”.
 *
 * The window handler now routes a drop to intake whenever a capture tab is in
 * front (app.ts, `intaking`), which is the app’s own philosophy applied where
 * it had not been: dropping a book at the app is not aiming at a rectangle, and
 * neither is dropping photographs. So this strip is no longer the only way in —
 * it is the OBVIOUS one, kept because a gesture with nowhere visible to aim is
 * a gesture people do not discover.
 *
 * `stopPropagation` therefore now prevents a DOUBLE INTAKE rather than a wrong
 * one. Both paths call the same `intake`, and without it a drop on the strip
 * would be answered twice.
 */
/**
 * How far a pointer must travel before a press becomes a sweep rather than a

 * enough that a click with a shaky hand is still a click.
