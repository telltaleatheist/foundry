/**
 * Home — what the app is when nothing is open.
 *
 * Three things, in the order a person needs them: the books they have worked on,
 * a target big enough to drop a book on without aiming, and the two actions
 * worth a button. The drop target is decorative in the strict sense — the WHOLE
 * WINDOW accepts a drop (see App) — but a rectangle that says "drop here" is how
 * anybody knows that.
 *
 * ── The list is PROJECTS, not files ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A row is a BOOK — one folder holding the scan, the cast EPUB, a translation,
 * the real-text PDF — and the tags on it are the answer to "what has been made
 * from this?", which a flat list of filenames could not give.
 *
 * CLICKING A ROW OPENS THE BOOK, and it used to open a drop-down instead. The
 * expansion was a list of every document in the project and a second click to
 * choose from it — which is the right question asked at the wrong moment: nine
 * times out of ten the answer is "the scan", the user knew that before they
 * clicked, and the menu was a step between them and the thing they came for.
 * `originalOf` picks it (ProjectsService) and the row opens it directly.
 *
 * THE OTHER DOCUMENTS ARE NOT GONE, THEY MOVED. They are in the open-documents
 * nav now, grouped under the project, where flipping between a scan and the book
 * cast from it is one click and stays available while you read — which is when
 * that question is actually asked. It was never a question for a screen you are
 * about to leave.
 *
 * A row leaves this list ONE WAY, and it takes the book with it. There is no
 * Clear and no "forget this", deliberately: the old recents list was a cache of
 * names and dropping one cost nothing, but this one is the library itself, and a
 * button that made a book vanish from the only screen that lists it while
 * leaving the folder on disk would be a delete button wearing a nicer word.
 *
 * So the button beside Reveal is the honest version of that: it DELETES — the
 * project directory and everything in it, off the disk, for real. The question
 * is asked in the app's OWN confirmation now (ConfirmService) rather than in a
 * native message box, but every word in it is still main's: the size on disk,
 * the readings bank, the filed copy (`projects:describe` in electron/ipc.ts).
 * This side's job is to refuse early when a document from the project is open,
 * to ask, and to say what happened.
 *
 * IT IS THE SAME CARD THE SIDE NAV USES to delete one document. There is exactly
 * one confirmation in this app, and it looks the same wherever the thing being
 * ended is — which is what stops a second, softer one being invented later.
 *
 * IT IS ALWAYS THE WHOLE WINDOW NOW, and that is the single-viewer ruling
 * reaching this file (docs/PLAN.md §4, unit 8b). It used to be two things: the
 * app's first screen, AND what an empty COLUMN showed — Ctrl+\ made a column with
 * nothing in it, and the useful thing to put in one was the library. Drawn as a
 * column it carried a ✕ of its own, because a column you asked for and changed
 * your mind about has to be a column you can put away. There are no columns, so
 * there is no ✕ and no `pane` input: this screen appears when nothing is on
 * screen and no project is held, and it fills the window it appears in.
