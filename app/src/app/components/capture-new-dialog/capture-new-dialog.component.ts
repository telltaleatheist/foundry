/**
 * NAMING A BOOK BEFORE PHOTOGRAPHING IT — scrim and card, like every other
 * dialog here.
 *
 * ── Why this replaced a field on Home ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first version put the input and its two buttons inline in Home's action
 * row, and Owen's first look at it was "the input/buttons for create new
 * project are all crammed together with no spacing". He is right and the reason
 * is not really the spacing: this app asks every other question that has a text
 * field and a confirm in a MODAL, and five components already do it. A sixth
 * shape in the action row was the deviation, and no amount of padding would
 * have made it stop being one.
 *
 * The original argument for the inline field was that `window.prompt` does not
 * exist in Electron's renderer, so the button would have looked broken. That
 * argued against `prompt()`. It never argued against a dialog, which is what
 * the app does everywhere else — I reached for the wrong alternative.
 *
 * ── The name is asked at all because it is ONE-SHOT ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The project's folder stem is made from this and the catalogue never renames
 * files under anybody (docs/CAPTURE.md). A default of "Photographs" would be
 * permanent, and permanent is too long to live with a name nobody chose. So the
 * field is empty, the placeholder asks the question, and an empty answer is
 * still allowed — main names it `Photographs` and that is then somebody's
 * decision rather than the app's.
