/**
 * THE HITS PANEL — what the analysis found, in the slot Compare would have had.
 *
 * Owen, 2026-08-25: *"it should light up/highlight text that matches the
 * categories, and have a list of hits in blocks on the right side, where compare
 * would normally be."* This is the right-hand side. The lighting is the paper's
 * own (`book-view.component.ts`), driven by the same signals this panel reads, so
 * the two halves of that sentence can never disagree about which passages are in.
 *
 * ── IT IS A COLUMN AND NOT A MODAL, WHICH IS THE POINT ──────────────────────
 *
 * The sweep is a card, and it CLOSES when a row travels: the point of that trip
 * is to look at the paragraph, and a modal over the page would be the one thing
 * in the way. This is a column standing beside the page, so travel closes
 * nothing — you click a card, the paper scrolls, the list is still there, and the
 * next one is one click away. That is the whole argument for taking Compare's
 * slot rather than being a seventh dialog (docs/ANALYSIS.md §8).
 *
 * ── THE REWORK, 2026-08-25, CLAUSE BY CLAUSE ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first cut of this panel was sections: a category heading, then its
 * findings, then the next heading, each row a chip naming a block id, a
 * quotation with the hit lit inside it, and a hover glance holding a longer
 * quotation. Owen read it and said what was wrong with it:
 *
 *   *"lets rework it a bit so each item is in its own block, in the order in
 *   which it appears. maybe each category has its own color or something… im
 *   not sure what the items next to the quotes mean. b151-5? b159-2? those arent
 *   necessary for a human to see. the tool tips are just repeating whats already
 *   on screen - unnecessary. and they shouldnt be highlighted inside the
 *   analysis, they should be highlighted inside the document viewer (as they
 *   are). as i scroll/click highlighted text, it should jump to that spot in the
 *   analysis"*
 *
 * Every clause is answered here and each answer is a rule rather than a tweak:
 *
 *   **ONE CARD PER FINDING, IN THE BOOK'S ORDER.** The grouping is gone. A list
 *   beside a book is read AGAINST the book, and grouping scatters one page's
 *   findings down five sections — so the list is the flat sequence `place()`
 *   already returns, which is reading order (core/analysis.ts). What the
 *   headings used to carry — the category names and their counts — is the legend
 *   above, where it is also the filter.
 *
 *   **A HUE PER CATEGORY, ON THE RAIL.** The card's left edge is the category's
 *   colour, which is the app's own gutter-rail idiom (the block chrome next
 *   door), and the same colour is the legend's dot. The hues come from ONE table
 *   (`ANALYSIS_CATEGORIES`, shared/analysis-categories.ts) and mean nothing as a
 *   scale — there is no severity in this feature and a cool-to-hot table would
 *   have smuggled one in through the paint.
 *
 *   **AND THE PAPER KEEPS ITS ONE INK.** docs/ANALYSIS.md §8 — *"the page must
 *   not turn into confetti"* — stands exactly as written, and this table does not
 *   reach it: `Piece.hit` is still one field with no category in it and the sheet
 *   still lights every finding in `--ink-hit`. Colour here is a legend for a
 *   list; colour there would be four inks on a paragraph.
 *
 *   **NO BLOCK IDS.** `b151-5` is a coordinate this program keys ops and travel
 *   by, and it is not a thing a reader has any use for. It is gone from the
 *   surface, and the codebase's standing rule about filenames in user-facing copy
 *   is read here as covering it: a person is shown the words and the page, never
 *   the address the words are filed under. TRAVEL IS THE WHOLE CARD, which is
 *   also the fix for what the chip cost — a button the size of a chip inside a
 *   row the size of a paragraph is a target you can miss.
 *
 *   **NO TOOLTIP THAT REPEATS THE CARD.** What was on hover is on the card, in
 *   words, or it is not there at all: the categories a passage ALSO matched are
 *   named instead of counted, and the verifier's rejection is a sentence under
 *   the quotation instead of a two-word chip with the sentence hidden behind it.
 *   The three that remain each say something the surface does not — what a tier
 *   means, and that the score is not a severity.
 *
 *   **THE GLANCE IS CUT, and that is a judgement rather than an omission.** It
 *   was the one hover on this panel that showed MORE than the row did (the fuller
 *   passage), so it survives the "repeats what is on screen" test — and it goes
 *   anyway, because the rework gives its job to something strictly better. A card
 *   click now travels to the passage AND the paper scrolls this list back, so the
 *   fuller passage is not a rectangle that appears under a pointer held still: it
 *   is the book, in the column beside the list, with the words lit in place. A
 *   floating preview of a paragraph you are one click from reading is a worse
 *   copy of the reading — and it was a rectangle that appeared under the pointer
 *   exactly where the pointer is now aiming at a click target.
 *
 *   **THE QUOTATION IN THE CARD IS PLAIN PROSE.** *"They shouldnt be highlighted
 *   inside the analysis, they should be highlighted inside the document viewer
 *   (as they are)."* The flagged words keep a little weight so the eye finds them
 *   in the sentence, and they carry no highlight ink: two surfaces painting the
 *   same marker pen makes the panel look like a second copy of the page instead
 *   of an index into it.
 *
 * ── THE TWO-WAY SYNC, AND WHOSE MANNERS PROBLEM IT IS ───────────────────────
 *
 * *"As i scroll/click highlighted text, it should jump to that spot in the
 * analysis."* Two halves. The paper owns the measuring, because the DOM being
 * measured is the paper's (`release` and `followAnalysis`,
 * book-view.component.ts); it writes two signals and holds no opinion about them.
 * This panel owns the OBEYING, because when to follow is a question about the
 * list a hand is on:
 *
 *   * A CLICK IS ALWAYS OBEYED and always brings its card into view. It is a
 *     deliberate act, and a deliberate act that sometimes did nothing would be
 *     the worst of the three behaviours available.
 *   * AND THE FINDING STAYS SELECTED, PULSING ON BOTH SIDES, until the reader
 *     says otherwise. Owen, after the first cut: *"when i click a highlighted
 *     block, the corresponding analysis block only blinks for about 1/4 of a
 *     second. can we make it pulse? on either side. have it pulse as long as it's
 *     selected. if i click the block, the text block pulses until i click
 *     somewhere else or scroll offscreen."* A blink announces and is gone; a
 *     pulse is a state, and a state is what this gesture needs, because the whole
 *     point of clicking a passage is to then look at the other end of the room.
 *     The selection lives in `AnalysisViewService.selected` — one nullable key,
 *     both surfaces drawing it — and it is let go of by a click that is not on it
 *     (either surface), by a click that selects another, or by its passage
 *     scrolling off the page (watched on the paper, which is the thing being
 *     scrolled).
 *   * A SCROLL IS OBEYED ONLY WHEN THE LIST IS NOT BEING READ. The pointer
 *     resting over this column pauses it outright, and scrolling the list by hand
 *     pauses it for `FOLLOW_REST_MS`. A list that scrolls itself out from under
 *     somebody's eyes is worse than one that lags: the lag costs a scroll they
 *     were going to make anyway, and the fight costs them their place.
