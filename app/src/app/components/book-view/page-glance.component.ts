/**
 * THE PAGE THE BLOCK WAS PRINTED ON, beside the block.
 *
 * ── What was asked for ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * *"i want to hover over a block and see that page of the original beside it."*
 *
 * Everything needed to answer that has been in the book file since v2 and no
 * surface had ever used it: a row carries the page it started on, the box it
 * occupied, and the render frame that box was measured in (BookRow.page, .box,
 * .pageWidth, .pageHeight). What was missing was the scan itself — a book tab's
 * path is the PROJECT directory, and nothing on the load named the document the
 * reading photographed. BookLoad.originalPath is that name, and this component
 * is everything downstream of it.
 *
 * ── IT IS NOT THE PEEK CARD, AND THE DISTINCTION IS DELIBERATE ──────────────
 *
 * The sheet already has a card beside the hand: the note peek, opened by
 * CLICKING a marker, joined to the click by a sienna leader, dismissed by
 * clicking again or by Escape (§4 of the sheet's own stylesheet). This is a
 * second card and it wears the same paper on purpose — a reader should not have
 * to learn two idioms for "a small sheet showing you the other thing" — but it
 * is a different gesture answering a different question, and conflating them
 * would be wrong in both directions. A peek is DELIBERATE and STAYS: you asked
 * for a note and it waits while you read it. A glance is INCIDENTAL and GOES:
 * it follows the pointer down the page and is gone the moment the pointer is.
 * So they have separate state, and both can be open at once without either one
 * having an opinion about the other.
 *
 * ── REST, NOT ENTER, and the difference is the whole feel of it ─────────────
 *
 * The trigger is a pointer that has STOPPED on a block, not one that has
 * crossed it. A pane of prose is a thing people sweep a pointer across on the
 * way to somewhere else, and a card that appeared on every crossing would flash
 * a dozen times on the way down a page — each flash costing a PDF page render.
 * The timer lives in the sheet's own pointerenter/pointerleave, so this
 * component is told to show a row or told to show nothing and never has to
 * reason about pointers.
 *
 * The same delay is what makes the NO-PAGES answer bearable. A book that
 * arrived as an EPUB has no paper behind it, and this card says so in words —
 * which on an enter-triggered card would be a sentence flashing at somebody
 * reading, and on a rest-triggered one is a sentence that appears exactly when
 * a person stopped and waited to find out. They read it once and stop waiting.
 *
 * ── ONE RENDER IN FLIGHT, AND THE OLD ONE IS CANCELLED, NOT AWAITED ─────────
 *
 * Resting on a block, moving to the next and resting again is the ordinary
 * gesture here, and pdf.js will happily queue every page it is asked for. So
 * each request cancels the outstanding render and bumps a generation, and a
 * task that resolves for a generation nobody is looking at draws nothing.
 * Without that, walking down a page of forty blocks leaves forty renders racing
 * to paint one canvas and the LAST to finish wins — which is not the one the
 * pointer is on.
 *
 * ── IT IS MOUNTED FOR THE LIFE OF THE PANE, AND EVERYTHING BELOW DEPENDS ON
 *    THAT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A null row means "show nothing"; it does not mean "go away". Two sections of
 * this header — one worker built once and kept, a cache that makes the second
 * glance at a page free — are claims about state that survives a glance, and
 * they were BOTH FALSE for as long as book-view put this card up behind an @if
 * and took it down on every pointerleave. MEASURED, walking ten rests down one
 * book: ten pdf.js workers built, none terminated, every glance re-reading the
 * whole scan over IPC and re-parsing it, 0.7-1.0s each and never falling.
 * Mounted once, the same walk builds ONE worker and costs ~0.2s a glance.
 *
 * The lesson is worth more than the fix: a docblock arguing for an economy is
 * not evidence there is one. Nothing in this file was wrong — the thing that
 * made it a fiction was one @if in a different file.
 *
 * ── THE CACHE IS SMALL ON PURPOSE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every block on a printed page glances at the SAME page, so the second rest on
 * a page should cost nothing — but a book is hundreds of pages and a bitmap is
 * megabytes, so this holds CACHE_PAGES of them and evicts the oldest. Twelve is
 * roughly "the spread you are working on and what you just came from", which is
 * the whole of the locality a reader has.
 *
 * page.cleanup() after every render, which is pdf.js's own door for releasing a
 * page's parsed operator list. Without it, a walk through a book leaves every
 * page it touched resident in the worker for as long as the document is open.
 *
 * ── pdf.js IS LOADED ON THE FIRST GLANCE AND NOT BEFORE ─────────────────────
 *
 * app-book-view is NOT deferred — it is what a book tab draws and the app's
 * whole surface leads to it — so a static import of pdf.js here would put half
 * a bundle in the chunk this window boots with, which is precisely what
 * viewer.component.ts defers the PDF branch to avoid. So the import is dynamic,
 * taken the first time somebody actually rests on a block, and a book nobody
 * glances at costs nothing at all.
 *
 * The worker is built the way app-pdf-view builds its own, for the reason its
 * header sets out at length: handing pdf.js a workerSrc sends a packaged build
 * down the blob-wrapper path, into the CSP, and out the other side as a FAKE
 * worker on the UI thread with no word said.
