/**
 * THE BOOK — a proof sheet on a dark workbench, and the one surface this app
 * will edit.
 *
 * ── What this is, and what it replaces ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * *"we arent supposed to be rendering the book as an epub. it's supposed to be
 * rendered as an html page… the user isnt reading a book on foundry, they're
 * editing the contents of a book."* (docs/RENDERER.md §0.) The cast EPUB in an
 * iframe was the flowing document while nothing else flowed; what flows now is
 * the BOOK FILE — one row per block, ids minted, hyphens fused, page turns
 * joined — read over IPC and drawn as Angular DOM. No iframe, no sandbox, no
 * postMessage, no injected script, and no book unzipped anywhere.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS ON SCREEN IS A PURE FUNCTION, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN ──────
 *
 * `view()` is `replayOps(rows, [...chain, ...pending])` and nothing else. There
 * is no incremental mutation anywhere in this file: a strike does not reach into
 * a row and set a flag, it PUSHES AN OP and the whole book is folded again. That
 * is affordable because the fold is one pass over an array this component is
 * already holding, and it is worth having at any price, because the alternative —
 * a stack of ops beside a set of rows somebody edited to match — is two accounts
 * of one book, which is the four-places-per-strike failure this wave exists to
 * end (docs/RENDERER.md §1).
 *
 * The CHAIN is what main read off the edit steps on the path from the position
 * (`BookLoad.ops`); PENDING is the LIFO stack of what has been done since. Undo
 * pops, redo re-pushes, Apply writes the stack down as a step and clears it — at
 * which point the pointer moves, the pane reloads, and the very same ops come
 * back on the chain.
 *
 * CLOSING WITHOUT APPLY USED TO SCRAP THE STACK (docs/RENDERER.md §3), and Owen
 * reversed that on 2026-08-22 after a project lost real work to it. Every gesture
 * below now also writes the difference to the project's sidecar on a debounce
 * (`remember`, and `BookStacksService` at the other end), and `load` puts it back
 * at the same step. The closing question stays and stops being a warning: it is
 * the offer to RECORD the work as a step, which matters because everything made
 * from this book is built from the recorded steps.
 *
 * ── THE GESTURES, and which op each of them mints ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Delete over a selection strikes and restores; a double-click puts a caret in a
 * block and a blur commits its words; the margin chip's list relabels. The
 * structure gestures landed with the replay that performs them: the seam's
 * `··· join ···` ghost IS the merge now, Enter at the caret cuts a paragraph in
 * two, Ctrl+J joins two blocks a person picked, and a double-click on a chapter
 * chip renames the division in place. The panels in the shell mint the rest —
 * link, restore-furniture and the four other chapter verbs — onto this same
 * stack, through the registry (`BookStack`, core/book-stacks.service.ts).
 *
 * TWO GESTURES ARE DEFERRED OUT LOUD and their ops exist regardless: dragging a
 * block to repair reading order (`move`) and dragging a chapter rule to another
 * block (`chapter` with `move`). Both are drop targets, autoscroll and a lift —
 * real UI machinery — and both are named where they would hang, below.
 *
 * ── The undo chord is ROUTED here, never listened for ───────────────────────
 *
 * Ctrl+Z is a menu accelerator main swallows, and the renderer decides which of
 * its three undos a chord meant (`MenuAction`, shared/api.ts). `BookStacksService.replay`
 * is where that decision lives; this component registers a `BookStack` with it and
 * adds no key listener of its own, because two answers to one keypress is how a
 * text field and a book both take something back.
 *
 * ── The selection is this component's and nothing else's ────────────────────
 *
 * It is not a fact about the book, it is in no undo stack, nothing on disk
 * records it and a reload starts with nothing selected — the same ruling the
 * frame selection has always had — a set of block ids and the category they
 * share, held by the surface that draws them. It
 * lives here rather than in the service because nothing outside this pane can
 * act on it yet; the day the inspector can, it moves up, and moving it before
 * then would be a wire with nothing on either end.
 *
 * ── Virtualization, and why there is no library in it ───────────────────────
 *
 * A four-hundred-page book is thousands of blocks. `content-visibility: auto`
 * with `contain-intrinsic-size` is the browser skipping the layout and paint of
 * everything off screen, natively, with the real DOM still there for scrolling
 * to, jumping to and hit-testing against — which is the whole of what a virtual
 * scroller buys and none of what it costs (a fixed item height, a scrolling
 * viewport of its own, and a dependency). This is Chromium and the feature is not
 * in question here.
 *
 * IT IS ON A WRAPPER INSIDE EACH BLOCK AND NOT ON THE BLOCK, which looks like a
 * detail and is not: `content-visibility` brings PAINT CONTAINMENT with it, and
 * paint containment clips a box's descendants to its own bounds. Every mark this
 * design puts in a gutter is outside the text column by construction, so a
 * contained block host would clip away every rail, chip, ghost and flag on the
 * page. The host carries the chrome, the wrapper carries the words and the
 * containment, and neither interferes with the other.
 *
 * ── Every mark on the page is RENDERER-DESIGN.md's ──────────────────────────
 *
 * That file is law for the appearance and nothing below invents anything visual:
 * the tokens are copied from its §1, the paper from §2, the block chrome from §3,
 * the structure marks from §4, the two quiet states from §5 and the motion rules
 * from §6. The category inks come from `shared/categories.ts` — the ONE table —
 * and are used only as rails, tints and chips at the alphas that file's own
 * header insists on, so the page never turns into confetti.
 *
 * ── The text is TEXT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every word a block carries reaches the DOM through interpolation. Nothing here
 * touches `innerHTML`, not on the model's output and not on anybody else's: a
 * book is ultimately somebody else's words arriving through a model's answer, and
 * the one thing this app will not do is hand them to a parser that can execute.
 * The reference numbers are the only structure drawn INTO a block's text, and
 * they are drawn from OFFSETS the engine resolved (`BookRef`), never by matching
 * digits — the same digits appear five times on a page of a book with fifty notes
 * in it.
 *
 * ── TWO REGISTERS, ONE TOGGLE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * *"Workbench — the working view. Paper + gutters + chrome. Edition — the export
 * preview. The same replay with ALL chrome removed and the export stylesheet
 * applied."* (docs/RENDERER-DESIGN.md §0.) The edition is a PROJECTION of the
 * very list the bench is drawing — one more pure function over `lines()`, no
 * second replay, no IPC and no engine, which is what makes it *"a toggle, not a
 * build"* (docs/RENDERER.md §5). What moves lives in `./edition`; what is merely
 * left out is a selector under the one host class, at the bottom of the styles.
 *
 * IT IS READ-ONLY AND EVERY EDIT GESTURE FLIPS IT BACK — §5's own sentence — and
 * the mode is deliberately NOT REMEMBERED anywhere: `mode` below says why.

   * against the paper: *"maybe make the text's highlighted color the same color
   * as the analysis block."*
   *
   * THAT IS THE OVERRIDING WORD AND IT IS ALSO THE BETTER ANSWER. The confetti
   * argument was about a page speaking a code with no key — eleven category
   * colours down a margin that a reader has to memorise. This is not that: the
   * legend sits two inches away in the panel, every card wears the same hue on
   * its rail, and a report names three or four categories rather than twelve. The
   * tint and the card are ONE FACT DRAWN TWICE rather than two facts competing,
   * which is the exact thing `shared/categories.ts`'s header says a colour has to
   * be to be worth having ("the whole point of colouring them is that the two
   * agree").
   *
   * WHAT SURVIVES INTACT IS THE ALPHA DISCIPLINE, which is where the real hazard
   * always was: *"applied as an outline and a tint, never as text colour: this is
   * a book, and recolouring its words makes it unreadable."* The words stay black
   * on cream and only the wash behind them changes colour — see `tintOf`, which
   * is where the paper's own lightness and alpha are decided, separately from the

            THE ANALYSIS'S LIGHT IS A CLASS ON THE RUN and nothing else — no extra
            element, no \`innerHTML\`, no layer over the page. \`cut()\` already
            closed the run wherever the light changes, so a lit stretch IS a run
            and wearing the class is the whole of drawing it.

            \`ghost\` IS A PASSAGE THE VERIFIER THREW BACK, drawn only under the
            loosest tier and drawn faint: docs/ANALYSIS.md §8 asks for the net's
            whole contents, told honestly which of it was rejected, in the same
            shown-but-inert register a struck row wears.

            \`data-hit\` IS THE FINDING'S NAME AND NOT A LISTENER. Owen's
            2026-08-25 sentence — *"as i scroll/click highlighted text, it should
            jump to that spot in the analysis"* — needs a click on these words to
            say WHICH passage, and the way this sheet has always answered that
            kind of question is an attribute the press reads back off whatever it
            landed on (\`data-id\`, \`data-note\`, \`data-jump\`). A binding per run
            would be one listener per lit stretch on a page; one attribute is a
            string the walk already computed.

            THE BACKGROUND IS BOUND AND NOT DECLARED, because it is the
            CATEGORY'S colour now (Owen, 2026-08-25: *"maybe make the text's
            highlighted color the same color as the analysis block"*) and a
            stylesheet cannot know twelve of them. The rule in the styles keeps
            the geometry and the transition; \`tintOf\` decides the wash.

            \`on\` IS THE SELECTED FINDING, PULSING. *"Have it pulse as long as
            it's selected."* It rides ON TOP of whatever tint the category
            brought — a shadow and an outline, never a colour swap — so the
            emphasis is visible on every one of the twelve.

      *"Two scroll-locked columns over two book files with the same ids."*
      (docs/RENDERER.md §5.) The SOURCE is on the left and the TRANSLATION on the
      right, which is the order the work went in and the order a proof is read in.
      The right-hand column IS the pane — every gesture, every mark, the stack, the
      trays — untouched; the left is READ-ONLY CONTEXT and carries no chrome at
      all, because there is nothing on that sheet a person can decide (source edits
      stand ABOVE the translation, where changing the words changes the question
      the records answered).

      THE PAIR IS ALWAYS THIS ELEMENT, with one child or two. A wrapper that only
      existed while two columns did would mean the bench's own box changed shape
      when the toggle was pressed, and everything measured against it — the sticky
      trays, the marquee's coordinates — would be measuring a different thing
      depending on a mode.

      THE TWO REGISTERS — *"a two-segment control … \`Workbench | Edition\`,
      styled like the app's existing acts"* (RENDERER-DESIGN.md §5).

      ABOVE THE SCROLLER AND NOT IN IT, which reverses where this control
      stood and is the user's own ruling (2026-08-17): the head used to open
      the sheet's column and stick to the scrollport's top edge, and a stuck
      tray is a tray the words pass UNDER — *"the workspace/final version
      buttons at the top cover the file when i scroll down."* So the register
      stands in a row of the host's own column above the pair, the book
      scrolls in the box below it, and nothing the sheet says can arrive
      beneath these buttons because they are not over the sheet at all. The
      BOTTOM tray keeps its sticky edge: Apply is a verb somebody reaches for
      mid-page, and it should ride the scroll; the head is a REGISTER — a
      fact about the page rather than a verb on it — and a fact can hold
      still.

      A GROUP OF TWO BUTTONS AND NOT A CHECKBOX. \`aria-pressed\` on each says
      which one is in force in the one vocabulary a screen reader already has

          ── APPLY, WHERE THE PERSON IS ALREADY LOOKING ───────────────────────

          *"and maybe there should be another apply changes button somewhere
          obvious. the button on the side of the workbench works but it isnt
          obvious"* (Owen, 2026-08-22). The tray at the foot of the bench is
          right where it is and it stays — a verb you reach for mid-page should
          ride the scroll — but it is one small button in a corner of a wide
          bench, in the same weight as Undo beside it, and a person with three
          changes on the page and an export to run did not find it.

          THIS IS THE HEAD ROW, WHICH IS A ROW OF FACTS, AND A VERB IS NOT ONE.
          That objection is the head's own (see the register's comment below) and
          it is answered rather than ignored: this button is not furniture that
          sits here explaining itself. It EXISTS ONLY WHILE THERE IS SOMETHING TO
          APPLY, which makes it the same kind of thing as the rest of the row —
          a fact about this page, stated as the one press that changes it — and
          absent the rest of the time, on the house's absent-not-disabled rule.
          The tray's button is the opposite and deliberately so: it is DISABLED
          at zero, so the affordance can be learnt before there is anything to
          press it with. Learn it there; be caught by it here.

          THE ACCENT IS THE POINT and it is spent once. Nothing else on this
          surface is filled with it — the registers are the shell's greys, the
          paper has its own inks — so the one accent-filled thing in the pane is
          the one press that is waiting on somebody.

          IT DRAWS IN THE EDITION TOO, unlike the foot tray (which the mode makes
          \`inert\`). The argument there is that the tray is the bench's
          furniture and the edition has none; the argument here is stronger the
          other way. Looking at the finished book is exactly when somebody
          discovers a change they meant to record, and a stack is
          mode-independent — the edition is a projection of the same ops — so
          the press means the same thing from either register.

          THE COUNT IS THE TRAY'S OWN LABEL, not a second spelling of it. One
          function, one wording, two places it is drawn; the card that main
          composes says "Apply changes" without a number because its own title
          carries the count, and that is the seam's copy rather than this one's.

          AND THE SECOND CONTROL, WHICH IS NOT A THIRD SEGMENT.

          \`Workbench | Edition\` is the REGISTER — what kind of thing this page
          is — and Aligned is not a third kind of page: it composes with the
          workbench (chrome on the live column, the source beside it) and is
          meaningless against the edition, which is the finished book and has one
          column. A third segment would have said the three were alternatives and
          put "the finished book, with a working column beside it" on the list of
          things a person could ask for.

          IT IS ONLY THERE ON A TRANSLATED POSITION. There is no source to set
          beside a book in its own language, and a control that was permanently
          dimmed on every ordinary book would be furniture nobody could ever use.

          REFUSED RATHER THAN DISABLED. \`aria-disabled\` and not \`disabled\`,
          because a control that cannot be reached cannot say why it cannot be
          used: the title is for a pointer that pauses, and a PRESS puts the same
          sentence on the window's notice strip, where the rest of this app says
          what it would not do.

            ── GRAVESTONE: \`app-page-glance\` (2026-08-23) ─────────────────────

            The card that showed a clicked block's printed page stood here —
            15rem of fixed-position paper, placed by \`placeGlance\` against its
            own measured width, aimed by the click that selected a block. Owen
            retired it into the docked comparison column (./original-panel, at
            the pair's right edge): *"instead of having a little preview pop
            up, we should make it a full-page comparison that i can choose to
            pop up to the right of the workspace."* The card's hard-won
            machinery — the kept worker, the path-keyed open, the cancelled
            renders — moved with it; what died here was only the placement
            arithmetic, which a docked column does not have.
          -->
        </div>
        <!--
          APPLY — the stack, written down. ON THE BENCH AND NOT ON THE PAPER,
          which is the design law working rather than a placement preference:
          chrome lives in the paper's gutters and backgrounds, and a button is
          neither. It is the app's own \`.act\` in the app's own dark tokens, in
          the corner of the workbench, because that is where this app puts a verb.

          THE COUNT IS IN THE LABEL rather than beside it, on \`labelFor\`'s rule
          for a step row: "Apply" alone does not say whether it is about to record
          one strike or forty. DISABLED AT ZERO rather than hidden, so the
          affordance is somewhere a person can learn it is there before they have
          anything to press it with.

          AND IN THE EDITION IT IS \`inert\`. The tray is the bench's furniture and
          the edition has none of it, but a button faded to nothing is still a tab
          stop and still takes a press — so the mode does not hide it, it takes it
          out of the document. Apply is not gone, it is one press of Workbench
          away, and the head that gets you there is the only thing on the bench
          that stays.

      ── THE ORIGINAL PDF, DOCKED — the pair's third column ───────────────────

      *"i want the original pdf comparison, so i know what im looking at and
      how to correct it if dots makes a mistake."* (Owen, 2026-08-23.) The
      page-glance card retired into this: a full-height column in the
      workbench's gray, right of the paper, toggled from the head row and
      following the reading. ./original-panel carries the design. "ORIGINAL"
      AND NOT "COMPARE" IN EVERY NAME HERE, deliberately: compare is this
      app's word for standing two STEPS of the book side by side
      (compare-picker, the compare column), and one word must not mean two
      things one head-row apart.

      MOUNTED FOR THE LIFE OF THE PANE and closed with a class — the glance's
      own measured lesson about the @if that rebuilt its worker and emptied
      its cache every time the card blinked. A closed panel is handed a null
      row, so it draws nothing and costs nothing while staying warm.

        \`--ink-hit\` DIED HERE (2026-08-25), AND THE GRAVESTONE IS THE RULING.

        There was one highlight ink on this paper — an amber, #d9a441, laid at
        20% — and a long argument beside it saying there must never be more:
        *"One highlight ink on the paper — the page must not turn into
        confetti."* Owen overruled it, reading the reworked panel against the
        page: *"maybe make the text's highlighted color the same color as the
        analysis block."*

        HE IS RIGHT, AND THE OLD ARGUMENT WAS ABOUT A DIFFERENT PAGE. Confetti is
        what a page becomes when it speaks a code with no key — twelve colours a
        reader has to memorise. The panel beside it now IS the key: a legend of
        named, coloured chips, and every card carrying its category's hue on its
        rail. The tint and the card are one fact drawn twice rather than two facts
        competing, which is exactly what shared/categories.ts's header says a
        colour has to be to be worth having.

        WHAT SURVIVES IS THE ALPHA DISCIPLINE, which is where the real risk always
        was: the words stay black on warm and only the wash behind them is
        coloured — a pale stroke, never a pigment, and never the glyphs (*"the
        text shouldn't be a different color, just a light highlight color
        difference"*). The recipe is \`tintOf\` at the foot of this file, composed
        from \`analysisCategoryHue\` — the ONE hue table, which the panel's rails
        read too, so the two surfaces cannot disagree about which category is
        which colour. It is not a token because it is not one value.

     * figure rather than the body so that the mark is the size of the thing it
     * cancels: a crop narrower than the column would otherwise take an X sized to
     * the column with two thirds of it crossing empty paper.
     *
     * AND THE BODY'S OWN PAINT IS TURNED OFF UNDER A FIGURE, which is the half of
     * this that is easy to miss. Left on, a picture would carry TWO marks — one
     * sized to the body showing in the margins either side of a narrow plate, and
     * one sized to the figure — and where no plate was ever cut, the dashed empty
     * frame is transparent, so both would be fully visible, at two sizes, crossing
     * each other. One block, one X.
     *
     * ── The three things carried across from the rule above ────────────────
     *
     * (1) THE ANIMATION IS ON \`background-size\`, and it needs BOTH halves of the
     * pair or the mark pops into existence instead of growing across. So the
     * pseudo-element exists at all times and is 0%×0% when the block is not
     * struck, exactly as \`.body\` is — a pseudo-element that only existed under
     * \`.struck\` would have nothing to transition from and nothing to lift on
     * restore.
     *
     * (2) \`mix-blend-mode\` MAKES THIS AN ISOLATED THING, and the isolation is
     * already where it needs to be. A blended element blends with the backdrop of
     * the nearest ancestor that forms a group, and \`.body\` forms one twice over
     * — \`content-visibility: auto\` implies paint containment, and a struck body
     * is at \`opacity: .45\`. So the multiply happens against the PLATE and the
     * body's own tint, then the whole composite fades to 45% over the paper. The
     * mark reads as ink on the picture rather than as a decal over the sheet,
     * which is the same sentence RENDERER-DESIGN §3 wrote about prose.
     *
     * The honest cost of multiply is that it darkens and cannot lighten, so
     * across a region of a plate that is already near black the X approaches
     * invisibility. That is accepted rather than worked around: the alternative
     * is a normal-blend stroke, which reads as a sticker laid on the photograph
     * on every ordinary plate to buy back the rare one, and the two halves that
     * always land — the dim and the struck caption — carry the state there. THE
     * DARK THEME IS NOT A FACTOR AND IT IS WORTH SAYING WHY: the sheet's palette
     * is fixed light (§1 declares \`--paper\` and \`--ink-strike\` as constants and
     * this file has no \`prefers-color-scheme\` in it); the only token that follows
     * the shell's theme is \`--bench\`, the ground BEHIND the paper, and no mark
     * ever blends against it.
     *
     * (3) REDUCED MOTION covers selectors by name down at the bottom of this
     * sheet, and a new selector is not in that list until it is put there. It is.
     *
     * \`pointer-events: none\` because every gesture on this surface — hover,
     * select, the context menu — is bound on the block, and an overlay that ate
     * them would make a struck picture the one block nobody can restore.

      ── THE ANALYSIS'S HIGHLIGHT — a run wearing a class, and nothing else ────

      docs/ANALYSIS.md §8. It is a background on the RUN because \`cut()\` already
      closed the run wherever the light changes: no extra element, no
      \`innerHTML\` and no absolutely-positioned layer — an overlay would eat the
      gestures this surface is made of and turn a flagged paragraph into the one
      paragraph nobody can select, edit or strike.

      IT DRAWS ONLY WHILE THE PANEL IS OPEN, and that is not enforced here: the
      class arrives on a piece only when \`AnalysisViewService.lit\` has a range
      for the block, and that computed answers empty the moment the second column
      stops being an analysis. The paper is a workbench; a report is an apparatus
      somebody summons, not a permanent recolouring of the book.

      THE COLOUR IS THE CATEGORY'S AND IS BOUND, NOT DECLARED — Owen, 2026-08-25:
      *"maybe make the text's highlighted color the same color as the analysis
      block"*, and then, when the first attempt came back too solid, *"the text
      shouldn't be a different color, just a light highlight color difference."*
      This rule therefore carries the GEOMETRY and the transition and no paint at
      all: \`tintOf\` composes a pale stroke from the same hue table the panel's
      rails use, the walk in \`cut()\` puts it on the piece, and the template binds
      it. THERE IS NO GLYPH-COLOUR RULE HERE AND THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE — the
      words stay black on warm, which is both Owen's sentence and
      shared/categories.ts's standing alpha rule.

      ── THE SELECTED FINDING, PULSING ────────────────────────────────────────

      Owen, 2026-08-25: *"when i click a highlighted block, the corresponding
      analysis block only blinks for about 1/4 of a second. can we make it pulse?
      on either side. have it pulse as long as it's selected."* A blink announces
      and is gone; a pulse is a STATE, which is what a two-surface instrument
      needs, because the whole point of clicking a passage is to then look at the
      other side of the room.

      A SHADOW AND NOT A COLOUR. The tint underneath is already the category's,
      and twelve of those exist; an emphasis painted in any hue would collide with
      one of them and read as "a different category" on that one. A ring of the
      paper's own soft black sits on top of every tint equally and cannot be
      mistaken for one — it is the same reasoning the block's own selection ring
      is drawn under.

      SLOW AND SHALLOW: 1.9s is a breath, not a strobe, and the ring travels one
      pixel. A mark that is going to sit on the page for as long as somebody reads
      the panel has to be findable at a glance and ignorable at a paragraph.

   * the records, `pending` stayed empty, and the chord had nothing to pop.
   *
   * ── What a journal entry is, and what undoing one does ─────────────────────
   *
   * An `op` entry is a MARKER — the op itself stays on `pending`, which Apply
   * and the sidecar read exactly as before; the marker only records where it
   * falls among the corrections. A `words` entry carries the paragraph's before
   * and after, and undoing it is ANOTHER CORRECTION, back to `before` — through
   * the same `correct` door, so the records file stays the one truth and what
   * lands on disk is the honest history of somebody changing their mind. Redo is
   * the same door aimed at `after`.
   *
   * SESSION-SCOPED for the `words` half, deliberately: the ops half survives in
   * the sidecar as it always has, and a correction is already durable in the
   * records — what does not survive a reload is only the MEMORY of which
   * direction you were walking, which is `history.ts`'s own retired rule

   * ── AN INTERSECTION OBSERVER WAS THE OBVIOUS SHAPE AND IS NOT THE RIGHT ONE ─
   *
   * The thing worth watching is a lit RUN — that is where a finding's words
   * actually are — and a run cannot be watched from here. The runs live inside
   * `.body`, which is under `content-visibility: auto` (the class docblock: it is
   * on a wrapper INSIDE each block, never on the block, because paint containment
   * would clip every gutter mark away). A subtree that is skipped generates no
   * boxes for its descendants, so an off-screen run has no geometry at all: an
   * observer reports it as not intersecting — which is true and useless — and a
   * rect asked for directly comes back as zeros, which reads as a rectangle
   * sitting at the top-left of the viewport and would make the FURTHEST finding
   * look like the nearest. That is the measured reason this is a rect walk over
   * BLOCKS and not an observer over runs, and it is written down here because it
   * is exactly the sort of thing that gets "cleaned up" into an observer later.
   *
   * A block always has a box. The containment is on its wrapper, its height is
   * `contain-intrinsic-size`'s estimate while it is off screen and its real one
   * when it is not, and either way its position is a fact. So the walk is
   * `followOriginal`'s, verbatim in shape — the first block not cut off at the
   * fold, which is what a person would point at if asked where they are —
   * narrowed by the selector to the handful of blocks an open report lit.
   *
   * TWO THINGS KEEP IT CHEAP, both of them the neighbour's own rules. It returns
   * at once while nothing is lit, so a book with no analysis over it pays one
   * empty `querySelectorAll` per scroll frame and no arithmetic. And THE SIGNAL IS
   * WRITTEN ONLY WHEN THE ANSWER CHANGES: this runs outside Angular's scheduling

   * 4rem — a fraction of what a paragraph actually measures. Any scroll aimed

   * told to go. One `scrollIntoView({smooth})` landed a chapter-four heading in
   * the middle of chapter two; an instant jump with an after-the-fact settle
   * still left the block half off the screen, because the placeholders around it
   * resolve on the frames AFTER the one the settle checked.
   *
   * So the correction is not a step after the motion — it IS the motion. Each
   * frame measures where the target's centre actually stands against the
   * bench's, and closes a time-constant fraction of that distance: an ease-out
   * glide of about three-quarters of a second that a reader can follow, whose
   * aim is refreshed on every frame, so the layout growing underneath it is
   * absorbed while it travels instead of discovered after it stops. The chase
   * ends when the centres agree, and the bound snaps the last of the distance
   * closed so a landing is centred even if the clock runs out first.
   *
   * THE SCROLLBAR STAYS THE READER'S. A wheel or a press on the sheet while the
   * glide is in flight cancels it — the app asked to move the page, the person
   * moved it instead, and the person wins. Reduced motion collapses the chase to
   * its endpoint: the same loop with the whole distance closed each frame, which

   * the held stack OUT LOUD and says where it is — *"stand on the step you made
   * them at to pick them up"* — and the first gesture afterwards writes over it.

   * *"i notice ctrl+z and shift+ctrl+z dont really do much of anything."* They

   * An undo nobody can see is indistinguishable from an undo that is broken,
   * which is `BookStacksService.replay`'s own standard for the refusals — this
   * extends it to the successes.
   *
   * So every pop says a sentence naming the change and the count still waiting,
   * and the sheet glides to the block it happened to and pulses it — `land`, the
   * same landing every panel jump already makes. After the next render, because
   * the replay has to put the block back (an undone merge, a redone insert)
   * before there is anything to scroll to; `land` answers a block that is not
   * there by doing nothing, which is right for the one op with no block at all

   * Owen's ruling put in front of every act (2026-08-22): *"if they hit discard,
   * it does whatever action they selected to the step theyre on after dropping
   * changes they made."* The pane is one of the three places that stack lives —
   * the parked copy and the project's sidecar are the other two — and the service
   * empties all three in one call, because "discarded" changes that come back on
   * the next gesture or the next open are not discarded.
   *
   * ── BACK TO THE RECORDED BOOK, NOT TO AN EMPTY ONE ─────────────────────────
   *
   * `pending` starts life as a COPY of the tip's own ops when the position is an
   * amendable edit step (see `load`), which is what makes `waiting()` a
   * difference rather than a length. So the way back is `landedOps` — put the
   * list where the disk has it — and that is the same arithmetic read the other
   * way round: after this, `unwritten(landed, pending)` is zero by construction,
   * for a tip with ops and for a position without one alike. Setting an empty
   * array instead would have thrown away applied history on an amendable step and
   * then offered the removal to the next Apply as a decision nobody made.
   *
   * ── THE LIVE EDITOR GOES WITH IT, UNCOMMITTED ──────────────────────────────
   *
   * `apply` commits the block being retyped first, because "apply what is on
   * screen" has to include the words under the caret. This does the opposite for
   * the same reason: those words are unapplied work too, and committing them here
   * would push a text op onto a stack one microtask before it is emptied — or,
   * worse, after. `editingId` is dropped rather than blurred, so the editor
   * element is torn out of the view and its `blur` handler never runs.
   *
   * ── AND IT DOES NOT WRITE THE SIDECAR ──────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * No `remember()` here, deliberately, and it is not an omission the next reader
   * should fix. The caller clears the file immediately afterwards — which also
   * cancels the debounced write this pane may already owe — so a `remember` would
   * be one write racing one delete over a stack nobody wants. The next real

   * (`InsertOp`: an insert of nothing is a decision nobody can act on), and a
   * dialog asking for them would collect a paragraph somewhere other than where
   * it is going. A phantom abandoned empty decides nothing and leaves nothing —
   * no op, no row, no step.
   *
   * WHAT IT IS BORN AS: `Text`, always. The commonest miss is a chapter title,
   * but a default of Section-header would be wrong for every other kind of miss,
   * and the block arrives SELECTED — the category chip is already beside it, and

 * One block's text, cut at the reference numbers printed in it AND at every
 * change of the model's emphasis.
 *
 * BY OFFSET AND NEVER BY SEARCHING FOR THE DIGITS — the engine resolved these
 * with the page in front of it, and a marker found by matching text lands on
 * whichever occurrence of "1" came first. The markers arrive sorted, inside the
 * text and non-overlapping, all three PROVEN by the parser (`parseBookFile`,
 * shared/book.ts) rather than assumed here, which is what lets this be one
 * forward walk with nothing to decide.
 *
 * ── §18b: THE EMPHASIS IS AN EFFECT HERE AND CHARACTERS EVERYWHERE ELSE ─────
 *
 * The vision model writes `**bold**` and `*italic*` into a block's text, and
 * until now every layer of this program treated them as prose: the emitter has
 * turned them into `<strong>` and `<em>` since it was written, but this sheet
 * drew four asterisks around the name of every person who blurbed the book. The
 * user's ruling was that the effect should reach both — *"the bank should
 * display it correctly, basically."*
 *
 * **THE BANK AND THE BOOK FILE DO NOT CHANGE, AND THIS IS WHERE SOMEBODY WILL
 * BE TEMPTED.** The obvious tidy-up is to strip the markers once, at reflow,
 * and be done with them. It would corrupt every project already curated.
 * Foundry's edit ops index into block text BY CHARACTER OFFSET — a split names
 * a cut at an offset, a delete names `from` and `len`, a `BookRef` carries an
 * offset into the block it points into (shared/ops.ts, whose own comment says a
 * text edit invalidates every ref offset into that block). Taking four
 * characters out of a block moves every offset after them by four, and a replay
 * would then land that project's strikes and splits four characters off, on a
 * file nobody edited, with nothing raised. So the markers stay in the text, and
 * INTERPRETATION HAPPENS ONLY WHERE TEXT IS DISPLAYED — here, and in the
 * emitter. There is no third place.
 *
 * Which is why this is one function and not a second pass afterwards: the
 * reference-number offsets and the emphasis codes are both offsets into the
 * SAME source string, so the two cuts are interleaved in one walk and can never
 * disagree about which characters they are talking about. A run of the words
 * ends wherever either of them says it does.
 *
 * WHAT THE EDITOR SEES IS UNTOUCHED. The block editor renders `line.row.text`
 * verbatim, on the standing ruling that what is being edited is the model's
 * SOURCE STRING — asterisks and superscript digits included — and the caret
 * arithmetic a split is made from (`caretOffsetIn`) counts that string and not
 * this one. An edit therefore still commits exactly the characters the bank
 * holds, and the effect comes back the moment the editor closes.
 *
 * ── AND THE ANALYSIS'S HIGHLIGHTS ARE THE THIRD THING IN THE SAME WALK ──────
 *
 * *"Highlights are runs, not overlays"* (docs/ANALYSIS.md §8), and this is where
 * that ruling is kept. A report's findings are `[start, end)` spans into a
 * block's text — the same kind of offset as a marker's, into the same string — so
 * they join the cursor below and a run closes when the LIGHT changes exactly as
 * it closes when a marker or an emphasis does.
 *
 * THE TWO ALTERNATIVES WERE BOTH REFUSED BEFORE THIS WAS WRITTEN. `innerHTML` is
 * banned on this surface outright (the class docblock: a book is somebody else's
 * words arriving through a model's answer, and the one thing this app will not do
 * is hand them to a parser that can execute). An absolutely-positioned overlay
 * eats gestures, which is the pointer-events ruling the struck-figure X is
 * written under a hundred lines down — and it would make a flagged paragraph the
 * one paragraph nobody can select, edit or strike, which is the exact opposite of
 * what a report is for.
 *
 * THE RANGES ARRIVE MERGED AND NON-OVERLAPPING (`litRanges`, core/analysis.ts),
 * so this walk has nothing to decide at a character two findings both claimed.
 * That decision belongs where the findings are, and it is made there.

 * the analysis block."* One HUE SOURCE and two treatments, which is the only
 * arrangement that can keep the promise: `analysisCategoryHue`
 * (shared/analysis-categories.ts) is the single table, the panel turns a hue into
 * a colour for a charcoal ground and this turns the same hue into a wash for a
 * cream one. A shared colour STRING would have had to be legible on both, which
 * nothing is; a shared hue is legible on both by construction, because the
 * lightness and the alpha are where the ground actually gets accommodated.
 *
 * ── IT IS A PALE STROKE, AND OWEN SAID SO TWICE ────────────────────────────
 *
 * *"The text shouldn't be a different color, just a light highlight color
 * difference."* Two instructions in one sentence and both are obeyed here and
 * only here:
 *
 *   * NOTHING TOUCHES `color`. There is no glyph-colour rule for a hit run
 *     anywhere on this sheet and there is not going to be one — that is
 *     `shared/categories.ts`'s own alpha rule (*"applied as an outline and a
 *     tint, never as text colour: this is a book, and recolouring its words makes
 *     it unreadable"*) and Owen's sentence is the same rule said again about this
 *     mark. This function returns a BACKGROUND and the template binds it to
 *     `background`.
 *   * IT IS LIGHT. 75% saturation at 68% lightness is a pastel, not a pigment,
 *     and 32% alpha over the sheet's cream lands it as a pale marker stroke —
 *     hued enough to match its card across the room, faint enough that the words
 *     stay black-on-warm and a paragraph carrying three findings is still a
 *     paragraph somebody can read. The first cut of this used a mid-tone (62/52
 *     at 22%, which was `--ink-hit`'s own recipe with the hue swapped in) and
 *     Owen sent it back for exactly the reason the numbers moved: a mid-tone at
 *     low alpha reads as a coloured patch, and a pastel at moderate alpha reads
 *     as a highlighter.
 *   * 14% for a verdict the verifier threw back — a shade under half the flag's
 *     alpha, which is the ratio the one-ink cut used (20 → 8) carried across. The
 *     dotted underline that says WHY it is faint is untouched and stays neutral:
 *     the ghosting is about the VERDICT and the tint is about the CATEGORY, and
 *     colouring the underline would be the one place two facts really did compete
 *     for one mark.
 *
 * MEMOISED, because `cut()` asks per run per repaint and a report names three or
 * four categories: the map is a handful of entries for the life of the window and
 * saves composing the same string a thousand times down a four-hundred-page book.
