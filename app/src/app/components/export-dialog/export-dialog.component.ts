/**
 * Export — the finished book, in the form you want to keep it in.
 *
 * ── It was called Generate, and the rename is the ruling ────────────────────
 *
 * A generate wrote a document into the project's working directories, where it
 * sat among the steps looking like one. It is not one: nothing is ever built on
 * top of it, no later step takes it as a parent, and the moment somebody
 * corrects a block upstream it is a stale copy of a book that has moved on. The
 * user said what it actually is — "it wont go into the working files as a step
 * because it isnt the base for new steps. its a terminal step. so its an export"
 * — and an export lands in the project's own filed folder, is listed under the
 * project rather than in the ledger, and opens as a tab you can close.
 *
 * The planning machinery is the SAME machinery (planConversion, the pipeline,
 * generate-under-a-translation, every refusal); only where the file lands
 * changed, which is why this is the old dialog reworked rather than a new one.
 *
 * ── Why this is a dialog of its own and not a field on the OCR one ──────────
 *
 * Because it is a different act with a different cost. Reading a book is hours
 * of GPU against pages nobody has seen: it is held, batched, and committed to
 * with a Start button. Exporting is arithmetic over answers that are already on
 * the disk — offline, no model, no server, seconds — and it is repeatable. The
 * two used to be one dialog and one job, which made the FORMAT a decision
 * somebody had to make before a single page was read, and made "could I have
 * that as text as well?" cost another three hours.
 *
 * So the reading is paid for once and this is free, as many times as you like,
 * in as many formats as you like.
 *
 * ── It runs immediately, and it opens what it made ──────────────────────────
 *
 * NO START GATE. The queue's hold exists so that hours of GPU are never spent by
 * the act of configuring them; there are no hours here to spend, and a person who
 * pressed Export and then had to find a shelf and press Start would be pressing
 * a second button to confirm a decision they made with the first. It still goes
 * through the queue — one engine at a time is a rule about the machine, not about
 * the person — so it waits behind a reading that is running, and the shelf shows
 * it moving.
 *
 * AND THE RESULT OPENS ITSELF, which is the point: somebody exports an EPUB
 * precisely because they want to look at it. That is OPENS_ITSELF in
 * OpenDocumentsService.
 *
 * ── No reading yet ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * TWO OPTIONS AND NOT THREE. There is no route in this engine from a scan to a
 * book that does not go through the model — the whole pipeline is built on the
 * bank of what it read — so "export without OCR" is not a thing this dialog can
 * offer to do. It says the pages have not been read and offers to read them.
 */
@Component({
  /*
   * ONE SELECTOR AGAIN. There were two for one wave: the shell mounted this
   * dialog by its old tag while `app.ts` still belonged to another unit, and an
   * app that answered only to the new name would have been an app with no export
   * dialog at all until that file was opened. It has been opened, the shell
   * writes \`<app-export-dialog />\`, and the second name went with the re-export
   * that stood beside the old path. A compatibility name that outlives its reason
   * is how a codebase ends up with two words for one thing and nobody sure which
   * one is real.

                IT USED TO SAY "the EPUB only", and it was true of a translated

                blocks as the book is assembled, upstream of the format fork — so
                plain text works from here too, and only the facsimile cannot.

                TWO REASONS, TWO SENTENCES. The card is dead for a book that

   *
   * These look contradictory and are not. `source()` above hands main the

   * resolves the archived original regardless of what it is given, and it reads
   * the POSITION for itself to decide whether a translate stage belongs in the
   * plan (`renderPipeline`). So the input has never been the thing that decides
   * WHICH book comes out; the position has.
   *
   * What was missing was the honest refusal at the top of the import chain. An
   * export is arithmetic over the bank a reading produced, and standing on the
   * import is standing BEFORE that reading: the user has deliberately stepped
   * back to the untouched scan, and an Export button live there would quietly
   * make the book they had just stepped away from (docs/WORKBENCH.md §6c — every

   * this window has not read yet answers null, and null is not the import — the

   * rule everywhere: a shut door explains itself, and a door shut on a guess does
   * not.
   *
   * AND IT IS NOT THE IMPORT WHEN THE IMPORT IS THE BOOK. Everything above is
   * about stepping BACK to the untouched scan from a reading made of it. A project
   * that arrived as a book has no reading to have stepped back from and exactly
   * one row in its whole ledger — the import — and that row is not a photograph of
   * the book, it IS the book: main reads that same position, an EPUB archive with
   * no reading in effect, as the instruction to explode the container
   * (`bookAtPosition`, electron/projects.ts). Refusing there would refuse the only

   * The engine refuses the pair by name (src/vlm/convert.ts) and main refuses it a

   * them has to say so.
   *
   * IT USED TO BE `epubOnly`, AND THE PLAIN TEXT CARD WAS DEAD WITH IT. That was
   * honest about the two-stage pipeline: an export standing under a translation
   * ended in `translate`, which reads a book and writes a book, so there was no
   * route to the text emitter at all. A translation is a records file now and its
   * words are substituted before the format fork, so plain text comes out
   * translated for free — one product this app could not offer yesterday.

   *
   * ── AND THERE IS A SECOND WAY TO HAVE NO PAGES TO REPRINT ───────────────────
   *
   * A book that arrived as a book never had any. The translation case is "there
   * is nowhere on this photograph to put those words"; this one is that there is
   * no photograph — no scan, no bank, no page geometry anywhere in the project —
   * so a facsimile is not a product that is unavailable from where somebody is
   * standing, it is a product this book has no version of at all. The two are one
   * dead card and two different sentences, said below; main refuses the pair for
   * the second reason as well (`planRendering`, electron/workspace.ts), so the
