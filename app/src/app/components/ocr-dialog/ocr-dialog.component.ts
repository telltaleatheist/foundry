/**
 * OCR — read the pages, and stop there.
 *
 * ── The question that left ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This dialog used to ask for an OUTPUT FORMAT, and a conversion was one act:
 * read three hundred pages with a vision model AND write an EPUB, chosen
 * together, spent together. That made the format a decision somebody had to
 * commit to before a single page had been read — and it made "actually, could I
 * have that as plain text too?" a question whose honest answer was another three
 * hours of GPU unless you happened to know that `--reuse-readings` existed.
 *
 * They are two acts. THE PRODUCT OF THIS ONE IS THE READING: a bank of the
 * model's answers, page by page, in the project, which is the expensive
 * irreplaceable thing everything else is made from. What the book eventually
 * BECOMES is chosen afterwards, from the Export dialog, as many times as
 * somebody likes, for nothing.
 *
 * So what is left here is the two questions that are genuinely about reading —
 * which pages are not part of the book, and what language they are in — and the
 * source. Three things it stopped asking earlier are still gone: the endpoint
 * (Settings owns the backend), the output path (nothing writes one now), and
 * "bank page answers" (always on; the bank IS the job).
 *
 * It ENQUEUES AND NOTHING ELSE, and the row it makes is HELD: reading is the
 * expensive job, the hold is what makes a batch possible, and Start is what
 * commits to it. The run is main's (electron/job-queue.ts), so dismissing this
 * dialog does not touch a job that is already moving.
