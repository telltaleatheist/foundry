/**
 * READING PHOTOGRAPHS — the minute the app cannot answer, made visible.
 *
 * ── Why this is a modal and not a strip ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Owen's ask was literally "it should pop up a progress modal", and the reason
 * it is the right shape is harsher than politeness: an intake blocks MAIN for
 * the better part of a minute, so the window really is unavailable — it cannot
 * be moved, and clicking anything does nothing until the current photograph is
 * decoded. A strip in the corner would say "something is happening" while the
 * rest of the app lied about being usable. A card over a dimmed window says the
 * true thing: come back in a minute.
 *
 * P1 has taken the block from one unbroken minute down to about 1.4 s per
 * photograph, which is what makes this drawable at all — a progress line that
 * cannot repaint is a nicer-looking freeze.
 *
 * ── NO CANCEL, and that is deliberate for v1 ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Deferred by name in the doc. A cancel that cannot interrupt a wasm decode
 * would stop between photographs at best, which means a button that appears to
 * do nothing for over a second — and a project half full of originals with a
 * recipe that does not list them. Half an intake is a worse thing to own than a
 * finished one somebody did not want.
 *
 * ── `done` SITS ONE BEHIND `file`, BY CONTRACT ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * `file` names the photograph IN HAND rather than the one just finished
 * (docs/CAPTURE.md, and P1's own reason: a line naming the finished one names
 * what the person has already waited for). So "3 of 27" beside IMG_0214 means
 * three are done and 0214 is being read now. Nothing here re-derives that; the
 * arithmetic was settled in the payload precisely so this component has none.
