/**
 * The LIBRARY, down the left — one provenance tree per open book.
 *
 * ── It was a documents list, and that was one selector too many ──────────────
 *
 * *"i feel like the available documents (on the left sidebar) and the steps
 * (right sidebar) are confusing. i could have a document open, the epub, but
 * have the pdf import step selected, and id never know that i just ran translate
 * against the original pdf rather than the generated epub because i had the
 * wrong step selected, since the right document was open."*
 *
 * The diagnosis was two selectors pretending to be one: this panel picked a
 * FILE, the inspector's Steps section picked a POSITION, and the actions keyed
 * off a mixture of both. So the two are merged here, into the shape the user
 * asked for — *"maybe we merge them and top level things get arrows that expand
 * down. steps applied to [x] document. the original document can be the root
 * since thats where it all started"* — and the Steps section left the inspector
 * for good. docs/WORKBENCH.md §6c is the ruling; this file is the half of it
 * that draws.
 *
 * ── The ledger was always a tree; this stops hiding it ───────────────────────
 *
 * Every step records the step it was made FROM (`LedgerStep.parent`), and
 * shared/types.ts:2385 says out loud that the flat chronological list was that
 * tree with the indentation taken off. The flattening was the right call for a
 * 260px accordion that had to say "what have I done to this book" in one
 * column; it is the wrong call for a navigator, because the one question a
 * navigator has to answer is "what was this made FROM" — which is exactly the
 * fact the flattening threw away. So: the import is the root, the reading hangs
 * under it, curation saves hang under the reading, and a translation is a new
 * book that nests and grows saves of its own.
 *
 * NOTHING IS RE-DERIVED FROM A FILE HERE. The parent chain is the ledger's own
 * (`LedgerService.historyFor`); the exports are `listProjects`' own; the labels
 * are the ones main wrote when the step was made. This component owns the
 * indentation and nothing else about the shape.
 *
 * ── The rows that died with the flattening ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE PER-PROJECT DOCUMENT ROWS ARE GONE — the "PDF" row, the "EPUB" row, the
 * available-but-not-open rows, the missing ones. They were a second inventory of
 * the same project alongside the steps, listed one-per-type, and every one of
 * them was reachable as a POSITION instead: the scan is the import row, the
 * flowing book is the reading, a translation is its own step. Two lists of one
 * thing is how somebody translates the scan while looking at the book.
 *
 * AND "EPUB" DIED WITH THEM as a name for a working document. *"im thinking we
 * shouldnt call the working files 'epub' until we export."* The evolving thing
 * you read, curate and translate is **the Book**; the word EPUB now appears in
 * exactly two places in this app — the export modal's card, and an export row's
 * label — and it means "finished". `typeLabel` survives because it still names
 * FILES: a loose tab from outside the library, and a copy somebody opened by
 * hand out of a project folder.
 *
 * ── What still hangs off a root, and why ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * EXPORTS ARE CHILDREN OF THE ROOT, at the same indent as the Book, with no
 * expand arrow and nothing ever under them. *"it wont go into the working files
 * as a step because it isnt the base for new steps. its a terminal step."* They
 * are not top-level: with three books open, exports floating at the root of the
 * panel would have lost their parentage, and "Facsimile PDF · 14 Aug" names a
 * product and a day, not a book. Named by product and date, never by filename,
 * because that is the pair of facts that tells two of them apart.
 *
 * THE FACSIMILE IS THERE BESIDE THEM, and it is the one terminal row nobody asked
 * for: a reading makes it the moment it lands, because the pages as they were
 * printed are half of what a bank is for (docs/RENDERER.md §0 A3). It is drawn
 * exactly as an export is — a leaf under the book, no arrow, opens a PDF — because
 * from the panel's side the two are the same statement: this was made, and nothing
 * is made from it.
 *
 * AN HTML FACE hangs off the root too. It is a face of a document rather than a
 * step, so it has no place in the parent chain; it is still a tab somebody has
 * open and a tab nobody can close is worse than a tab in an odd place.
 *
 * "A COPY YOU OPENED" IS NOW A NARROWER THING, and better for it. It used to be
 * every open file the catalogue did not list; now the catalogue's OWN files are
 * spoken for by the tree — a step is what the scan and the Book are — so this
 * row is left meaning exactly what it says: something inside the project folder
 * that the project does not claim. An archived copy, a file reached by hand.
 *
 * AND A STEP'S OWN RENDERING IS NOT ONE OF THOSE, which took a second reading of
 * "the catalogue's own files" to get right — a per-step cast is uncatalogued on
 * purpose, so for a while a translation drew both its step and a loose row
 * calling the cast an EPUB somebody had opened. `ProjectSummary.renderings` is
 * the missing half of the sentence; see the set it feeds, below.
 *
 * ── A STEP NODE IS NOT A TAB, and does not wear a tab's marks ────────────────
 *
 * No ✕ — the root is the single exception, and what its ✕ closes is the BOOK
 * rather than the step, which is the next section — no middle-click close, no
 * column badge, no accent bar for "on screen".
 * A step is a POSITION — clicking it moves where the project stands and the
 * panes follow — and the panel's statement about it is `.current`, one row in
 * the tree drawn in the accent. Marking step rows as "showing in column 3" as
 * well would put the second selector straight back: *"Tabs are windows onto the
 * selection, never a second selector"* (§6c). The rows that ARE tabs — exports,
 * HTML faces, copies, loose files — keep every one of those marks, because for
 * them the mark is the truth.
 *
 * ── The three ✕, and the header they came from ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE ROW'S ✕ STILL DELETES, on an export and on a copy inside a project, behind
 * the app's one confirmation. Outside a project it still CLOSES: a file opened
 * from elsewhere is not main's to erase and `documents:delete` refuses it.
 *
 * THE ROOT'S ✕ CLOSES THE BOOK, and it is the one place a node row wears one.
 * The group header that used to carry this went when the import root took its
 * place, and closing a book went with it into the right-click (§6c: *"Right-click
 * the import root → Close project"*). The menu is still exactly where that lives
 * — this button calls the same action through the same path, so there is one
 * close-book in this file and not two. What the menu could not be is FINDABLE: a
 * right-click is a gesture with nothing on screen to suggest it, so for anyone
 * who was not told, the only way out of a book was to close its documents one at
 * a time and hope the tree went with them.
 *
 * The rule it bends is worth stating so it is not read as a licence. What a step
 * row must never carry is a ✕ meaning "delete this step and everything made from
 * it" — that is the panel's most expensive ambiguity and it stays behind the
 * menu, with main's accounting of the cost. This is not that button: it closes
 * tabs, it writes nothing and destroys nothing, and the book is one click from
 * coming back off Home's shelf. So it wears the ordinary ✕ and not the danger
 * one, and it says "Close book" in words on hover, where the glyph alone would be
 * asking the reader to guess which of the two meanings it has.
 *
 * MIDDLE-CLICK STAYS CLOSE on every row that is a tab, unchanged. It is the
 * gesture people bring from every other application, and it cannot destroy
 * anything. It is NOT given the book as well: a root carries no tab, and a
 * middle-click that shut five documents at once would be this app's largest
 * gesture on its least deliberate input.
 *
 * ── Collapse is a session, not a setting ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every node starts expanded, and a collapse lives in this component and dies
 * with the window. A persisted collapse would be a book that opens with its own
 * history hidden, for a reason the reader took three sessions ago and has no
 * memory of; a tree five rows deep is not a thing anybody needs saved.
 *
 * ── Dragging ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A row dragged WITHIN this list reorders the loose files — the only place a
 * document's order still exists. Rows inside a project cannot be reordered:
 * their order is the ledger's and the catalogue's, and a line drawn above one
 * would promise a move the next redraw undoes. A row dragged onto the workspace
 * lands in a column (the workspace owns that half of the gesture). Step rows are
 * not draggable at all: there is no tab to carry.
 *
 * Native HTML5 drag and drop, with the same custom MIME the strips used, and the
 * window's own file-drop veil still tells the two apart by looking for `Files`
 * in the payload (see App). `dataTransfer.types` is the only part of a drag
 * readable before the drop, which is what that test is for and why the id itself
 * can only be read when the drop happens.

   * SPOKEN FOR BY THE TREE and are not drawn a second time as tabs. That is the
   * whole point of the merge: the step is the document. Their tabs are still
   * counted in `tabIds`, because closing the book has to close them and the
   * loose list must not pick them up as strays from nowhere.
   *
   * What is genuinely left over — an HTML face, a copy somebody opened out of an

       * one has been made has both — and the distinction they need is that one is
       * a copy they filed and one is the record this book keeps of its own
