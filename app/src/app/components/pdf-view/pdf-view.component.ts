/**
 * The scan — rendered here rather than by Chromium, so the app can show the
 * thing the engine actually wrote.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL is two complaints the <iframe> could not answer. Its
 * thumbnail rail is nailed to the left edge, cannot be moved, restyled or
 * turned off from outside the plugin, and eats a column of a window whose whole
 * job is showing a page. And there is no way to SEE WHAT A PAGE'S TEXT ACTUALLY
 * IS: a viewer draws glyphs, and the question this app is usually asking of a
 * converted book is what a copy-and-paste or a search would find in it, which
 * is not the same question. That mattered most when foundry's PDF conversion
 * wrote text in rendering mode 3 and Chromium drew nothing at all; it still
 * matters now that the text is visible, because a reprint whose words are right
 * and whose ORDER is wrong looks perfect and copies as nonsense. The strip here
 * is along the BOTTOM, on by default and one click to dismiss; the layer view
 * (below) is the other half.
 *
 * ── The worker ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * pdf.js runs its parser in a Worker, and this file CONSTRUCTS THAT WORKER
 * ITSELF rather than handing pdf.js a `GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc`. That is
 * not a preference. pdf.js checks whether the worker URL is same-origin with
 * the page (`PDFWorker._isSameOrigin`), and a packaged Electron renderer is a
 * `file://` document whose origin is the string "null" — so the check fails for
 * every URL, always, and pdf.js falls back to wrapping the worker in a `blob:`
 * URL meant for CDN loads. `script-src 'self'` refuses a blob worker, pdf.js
 * catches the failure and silently sets up a FAKE worker on the main thread,
 * and a 600-page scan then parses in the UI thread with nothing said. That is
 * precisely the quiet degradation ARCHITECTURE §8 exists to forbid. Passing our
 * own `Worker` as a port skips the origin check, the blob and the fallback.
 *
 * The worker and pdf.js's runtime data (cmaps, standard fonts, the JPX/JBIG2
 * wasm, ICC profiles) are copied into `dist/renderer/browser/pdfjs/` by
 * angular.json's `assets`, and addressed off `document.baseURI` — `/pdfjs/…`
 * under `ng serve`, `./pdfjs/…` beside index.html when packaged. Nothing is
 * fetched from a CDN, because this app is expected to work on a machine that
 * has never had a network. The data files are not optional decoration: a scan
 * with JPEG 2000 images renders as blank pages without the wasm, and a blank
 * page is indistinguishable from a broken one.
 *
 * ── The bytes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `api.documentBytes(path)` — IPC, not `fetch` on `foundry-file://`. The
 * argument is in electron/main.ts beside the handler; the short version is that
 * the page is served under `connect-src 'self'` and the allow-list is the same
 * one either way.
 *
 * ── The layer view ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The button beside "Thumbnails" splits the pane: the rendered page on the
 * left, and on the right the SAME text items, positioned by the same arithmetic
 * at the same scale, but drawn in ink on paper instead of in nothing. A layer
 * that sits where the ink does not is then visible at a glance rather than only
 * to a search that comes back empty.
 *
 * BOTH PANES ARE LAID OUT BY ONE FUNCTION (`layoutText`), and that is the whole
 * point of the feature. If the visible pane derived its positions separately it
 * could be wrong in its own way, and the user would be checking the checker.
 * The two differ by a CSS class and nothing else.
 *
 * The panes are kept together by COPYING scrollTop, not by matching a scroll
 * fraction. They hold the same page boxes at the same size with the same gaps,
 * so their scroll heights are equal by construction and one number keeps them
 * aligned line for line. A fraction would only agree at the two ends and drift
 * everywhere a fraction of a differing height is not a fraction of the other.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT DONE HERE: the layer view does NOT try to tell foundry's text
 * from anybody else's. It was considered back when every stream the conversion
 * wrote carried a `/FoundryTextLayer` mark, and it was out then for two reasons
 * — the renderer would need raw page objects pdf.js does not expose, and the
 * question is the wrong one. This pane shows THE text of the document in front
 * of you, whatever put it there. The mark is gone now (the conversion builds a
 * whole document rather than marking streams inside somebody else's), which
 * settles it: there is nothing left to filter on and nothing that should be.
 *
 * PRINTING IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. Chromium's viewer had it for free and this
 * does not, because a print pipeline is a second renderer at a second scale
 * with its own page-break rules — and the file is a PDF sitting on disk that
 * every OS already prints. Reveal (↗) in Home puts the user in front of it.

      same geometry reads twice: once as the page, once as what a search finds.
      \`user-select: text\` on both, because copying out of either is the point.

      EVERY span RULE GOES THROUGH ::ng-deep, and it is load-bearing: the spans
      are made by \`layoutText\` with document.createElement, and Angular's style
      emulation scopes a component's CSS by stamping an attribute on template
      elements — an attribute a dynamically created element never receives. The
      first version of this file wrote these as plain \`.text span\` and every
      rule silently missed: no absolute positioning (the whole layer piled up
      in the page's top-left), no transparent ink over the scan, no dark ink in
      the layer pane. The \`.text\` ancestor IS from the template, so the rules
      stay this component's own; only the leap to its children is unscoped.
