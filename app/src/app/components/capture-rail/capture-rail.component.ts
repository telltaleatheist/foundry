/**
 * PREPARE THIS BOOK — the light table's right-hand rail, and the answer to the
 * evening that produced it.
 *
 * ── Why a rail at all ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Owen minted before he had turned the pages, and said so: *"i minted but didnt
 * have an opportunity to rotate the pages"*. Nothing had gone wrong with the
 * data — a mint is a snapshot of the recipe rather than its funeral — but the
 * surface had offered the LAST ACT FIRST. Mint sat in the footer of the table
 * from the moment the photographs landed, and the three things you are supposed
 * to do before it lived inside a modal you had to know to open.
 *
 * So the three verbs come out of the modal and stand in a list, in any order,
 * with the act at the bottom of them. The rail is the whole of the fix; the
 * gate below is what stops it being advice.
 *
 * ── THE TICK IS THE PERSON SPEAKING, AND THE STATUS IS NOT ─────────────────
 *
 * Each row carries a live status read from the recipe and a tick the person
 * sets, and they are different kinds of thing on purpose: THE DERIVATION NEVER
 * CLEARS A TICK. Nothing here decides that a step is finished.
 *
 * That is not deference for its own sake. A shoot with no spreads must be
 * tickable on "split spreads" without lying, and no rule can know the pages are
 * turned right — one photograph in the acceptance shoot is a magazine
 * advertisement, portrait, the same shape as the volume, and a derived
 * turned-done would be confidently wrong exactly where wrongness is most
 * expensive.
 *
 * TURN PAGES CARRIES NO STATUS AT ALL, which is a ruling and not an omission. A
 * count of turns performed IS derivable and was withdrawn: a count needs a
 * denominator and a denominator asserts a target. The correct final state of
 * this shoot is twenty-five spreads turned and at least two photographs left
 * alone, so "25 of 27 turned" would read as two still to do and quietly ask him
 * to break two pages that are already right. A progress count without a true
 * denominator is a lie with a number in it.
