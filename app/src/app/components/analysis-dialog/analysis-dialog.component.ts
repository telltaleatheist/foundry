/*
 * THE TWO DEFAULTS ARE IMPORTED AND NEVER COPIED, exactly as the Translate dialog
 * imports them and for the same reason spelled there: they are the engine's own
 * defaults, they are what a person is shown before they change them, and a model
 * id written down twice is a bump that applies to one of two places.
 *
 * `DEFAULT_TRANSLATE_MODEL` IS THE RIGHT CONSTANT DESPITE ITS NAME, and the name
 * is worth one sentence rather than a second constant beside it. It is Owen's
 * standing ruling about which model this program asks — *"27b is the standard
 * we'll use for every task"* — and the verifier is one of those tasks
 * (docs/ANALYSIS.md §2 names the same value). A second constant holding the same
 * string would be the drift this import exists to prevent, arriving under a
 * better name.
 */

/**
 * Analysis — configure ONE reading of this book against the categories, and put
 * it in the queue.
 *
 * The Translate dialog's shape, deliberately (docs/ANALYSIS.md §7): it enqueues
 * and nothing else, the run belongs to main, and dismissing this does not touch a
 * job that is already moving. Three things differ, and all three are rulings.
 *
 *   **THE CHECKLIST IS THE QUESTION.** Which categories to look for is the whole
 *   of what makes this analysis this one — it decides what the report contains,
 *   and therefore whether a second run refreshes the row you have or files a new
 *   one beside it (`PARAMS_OF.analysis`, shared/ledger.ts). So the run is ordered
 *   from a list of CHECKBOXES and never from a text field: every name that leaves
 *   here is one the engine has a calibrated hypothesis, a first-draft hypothesis,
 *   or a saved description for.
 *
 *   **AND THE LIST CAN BE ADDED TO.** Owen, 2026-08-25: *"maybe the user can add
 *   more categories - even one-sentence descriptive ones. and they check off which
 *   ones they want to search for in this document."* Engine-side this is not a new
 *   door: `buildPlan` (src/analyze/plan.ts) has always taken a description-backed
 *   category and wrapped the sentence into its one hypothesis, and the two
 *   built-ins Owen named himself — anti-evolution, authoritarian-blueprint — came
 *   in through exactly that shape. What was missing was a way to say one from the
 *   app.
 *
 *   THE SENTENCE IS THE HYPOTHESIS, WHICH IS WHY THE FIELD ASKS FOR A CLAIM. It
 *   is scored against every sentence in the book as *"The author's statement
 *   matches this description: …"*, so "conscription" finds nothing and "the author
 *   argues that military service should be compulsory" finds something. The dialog
 *   says so, and every category made this way is marked untuned in the report,
 *   because nothing has calibrated a sentence somebody typed this afternoon.
 *
 *   ADDING ONE IS A SAVE AND NOT A KEYSTROKE, and that is what keeps the old
 *   sentence about free text true in its new form. A typed name becomes a category
 *   only by being written into `app-settings.json` through main's own door, where
 *   it is slugged, capped and collision-checked (`clampAnalysisCategories`); the
 *   plan door then admits a name only if that file already holds it. So the path
 *   from a text box to a prompt runs through a deliberate act of saving, and what
 *   reaches the engine is always a string main itself minted.
 *
 *   THEY ARE THE USER'S AND NOT THIS BOOK'S. The list persists app-level, beside
 *   the library folder, and reaches every book on the machine; what is decided per
 *   run is which of them are ticked. Removing one is allowed and costs no report:
 *   a report carries its own category list (`AnalysisReading.categories`) and the
 *   panel names a category it has never heard of by saying its id aloud
 *   (`analysisCategoryName`), so an old report goes on rendering in full after the
 *   category it names has been deleted.
 *
 *   **THERE IS NO SENSITIVITY CONTROL.** Owen, 2026-08-25: *"it flags absolutely
 *   anything that could possibly match and then we have a button that displays
 *   things that match strictly (only turn up a few options), a moderate filter, or
 *   a very loose filter."* The run captures ONCE at the widest calibrated net;
 *   strictness is three buttons on the panel, over stored scores, so changing your
 *   mind costs a click and never another hour. A knob here would be a knob whose
 *   good value is known, which is the shape this app keeps refusing.
 *
 *   **IT SAYS HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE, BEFORE THE BUTTON.** Ranking is minutes and
 *   verifying is one model call per surviving passage, which is an hour on a hot
 *   book. That is the fact somebody deciding whether to tick all twelve boxes
 *   actually needs, and a number met after the press is a number met too late.
