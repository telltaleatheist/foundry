/**
 * THE LIGHT TABLE — a capture project's whole surface, and the viewer's third
 * branch.
 *
 * ── What this component is FOR, which is almost nothing ─────────────────────
 *
 * It owns one piece of state: WHICH PHOTOGRAPH IS OPEN. Everything else it
 * holds is somebody else's — the recipe is `CaptureService`'s, the cards are its
 * `cards` computed, the gestures are `CapturePageEditorComponent`'s, and the
 * rules about what a gesture MEANS are in `geometry.ts` and the service. This
 * file routes between two children and a service and does not decide anything
 * either of them could decide better.
 *
 * That is deliberate rather than modest. The editor is testable by pointing it
 * at any image with any quads precisely because it has never heard of a project,
 * and the grid can be handed a list of cards from anywhere. Putting the recipe
 * into either of them would have bought one less file and lost that.
 *
 * ── The tab is a DIRECTORY, and that is why the open lives in an effect ─────
 *
 * `Tab.path` here is the project directory (`pathIsProject`, documents.service),
 * so there is no file to load and nothing arrives through `document:opened`.
 * The recipe comes from `capture:recipe-load`, asked for whenever the tab
 * changes — an effect rather than a constructor call, because a tab input can
 * be re-pointed at another project without this component being rebuilt.
 *
 * ── ONE SERVICE FOR THE WHOLE APP, AND THAT IS A LIMIT WORTH KNOWING ────────
 *
 * `CaptureService` is `providedIn: 'root'` and holds ONE recipe, so two capture
 * projects open at once would share it and the second would evict the first.
 * Today that cannot happen: `captureTabIn` never makes a second tab for the same
 * project, and the workspace shows one document at a time. It WOULD happen the
 * day capture panes can be compared side by side, and the fix then is a service
 * instance per tab rather than a flag here. Written down because the failure —
 * two tables showing one recipe — would look like a redraw bug rather than a
 * scoping one.

      THE OPEN PHOTOGRAPH LEAVING THE RECIPE USED TO STRAND THIS SCREEN.
      There was an @else here drawing "That photograph is no longer in this
      project" as a bare paragraph between the table and the mint footer --
      with no way to dismiss it, because the open id stayed set and the modal that
      owns Escape was the thing that had gone. And the table below it was DEAF,
      since it stops answering the keyboard while something is open over it.

   *
   * So the step is a photograph and the label carries both facts -- "Photograph
   * 5 of 27, pages 9-10 of 54". The page numbers are what he will count in the

   * has one position rather than two.
   *
   * ── STRUCK PAGES ARE INCLUDED, DELIBERATELY ────────────────────────────────
