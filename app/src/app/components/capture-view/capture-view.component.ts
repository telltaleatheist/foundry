/**
 * THE LIGHT TABLE — a capture project's whole surface, and the viewer's third
 * branch.
 *
 * ── What this component is FOR, which is almost nothing ─────────────────────
 *
 * It owns one piece of state: WHICH PHOTOGRAPH IS OPEN. Everything else it
 * holds is somebody else's — the recipe is `CaptureService`'s, the cards are its
 * `cards` computed, the gestures are `CapturePageEditorComponent`'s, and the
 * rules about what a gesture MEANS are in `geometry.ts` and the service. This
 * file routes between two children and a service and does not decide anything
 * either of them could decide better.
 *
 * That is deliberate rather than modest. The editor is testable by pointing it
 * at any image with any quads precisely because it has never heard of a project,
 * and the grid can be handed a list of cards from anywhere. Putting the recipe
 * into either of them would have bought one less file and lost that.
 *
 * ── The tab is a DIRECTORY, and that is why the open lives in an effect ─────
 *
 * `Tab.path` here is the project directory (`pathIsProject`, documents.service),
 * so there is no file to load and nothing arrives through `document:opened`.
 * The recipe comes from `capture:recipe-load`, asked for whenever the tab
 * changes — an effect rather than a constructor call, because a tab input can
 * be re-pointed at another project without this component being rebuilt.
 *
 * ── ONE SERVICE FOR THE WHOLE APP, AND THAT IS A LIMIT WORTH KNOWING ────────
 *
 * `CaptureService` is `providedIn: 'root'` and holds ONE recipe, so two capture
 * projects open at once would share it and the second would evict the first.
 * Today that cannot happen: `captureTabIn` never makes a second tab for the same
 * project, and the workspace shows one document at a time. It WOULD happen the
 * day capture panes can be compared side by side, and the fix then is a service
 * instance per tab rather than a flag here. Written down because the failure —
 * two tables showing one recipe — would look like a redraw bug rather than a
 * scoping one.

      THE OPEN PHOTOGRAPH LEAVING THE RECIPE USED TO STRAND THIS SCREEN.

      with no way to dismiss it, because the open id stayed set and the modal that

   * carries two pages. Walking the order page by page would show the same

   *
   * So the step is a photograph and the label carries both facts -- "Photograph
   * 5 of 27, pages 9-10 of 54". The page numbers are what he will count in the

   * him. Neither number has to be inferred from the other.
   *
   * ── In the ORDER, not in `photos` ──────────────────────────────────────────

   * The order is the arrangement, and the arrangement is what the grid draws and
   * the mint walks. Stepping through `recipe.photos` would be intake sequence,

   * has one position rather than two.
