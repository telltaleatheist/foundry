/**
 * The documents: one to five columns, one document in each.
 *
 * ONE PANE WITH ONE TAB IS THE OLD APP, EXACTLY. No divider is drawn, the strip
 * holds a single name, the viewer spans the window, and nothing on screen
 * mentions that a second column is possible — the split is a thing you go and
 * do, not a thing the app keeps offering. Everything below that is only reached
 * once there are two of something.
 *
 * ── The strips ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * EACH COLUMN CARRIES A CHROME-STYLE STRIP ALONG ITS TOP, and this REVERSES
 * their removal — see the reversal written out in `TabsService`'s header. The
 * strip is not a navigator (the documents list is, and it stays): it is the
 * thing three gestures need something to point AT.
 *
 *   ✕ closes that document.
 *   RIGHT-CLICK pins it, which exempts it from being replaced by the next thing
 *   clicked in the documents list and takes its ✕ away.
 *   DRAGGING it moves it — within this strip to reorder, into another strip to
 *   move it there, onto a pane's EDGE BAND to tear it into a column of its own.
 *   *"if they grab the tab and drag it to one of the sides, it enters split
 *   screen with the tab that was currently active when they dragged it."*
 *
 * A tab drag carries the SAME payload a documents-list row does, on purpose: the
 * drop side of the gesture — the middle of a pane, an edge band, the geometry
 * that tells them apart — is one piece of code that does not care which list the
 * thing came out of.
 *
 * A pane showing no document — which includes having no panes at all — is HOME.
 * Home is not a route and not a document: it is what a column is when nothing in
 * it is on top, which means closing the last document lands somewhere useful
 * instead of on a grey rectangle, and Ctrl+\ can make an empty column to drop
 * something into.
 *
 * FOCUS IS A POINTERDOWN ON THE PANE, which is the whole model. Pointerdown and
 * not click, for two reasons: it lands before the `click` of the same gesture,
 * so a button that acts on "the focused pane" already has this one by the time
 * it runs; and a drag that begins in a pane also means that pane, where a click
 * that never completes would have said nothing.
 *
 * ── Taking a dropped row ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A row dragged out of the list — or a tab dragged out of a strip — lands here,
 * and where in a pane it lands decides what happens: the MIDDLE shows it in that
 * column, an EDGE BAND opens a new column on that side. The preview says which
 * before the mouse comes up, because a drag with no preview is a guess.
 *
 * THE SHIELD IS NOT OPTIONAL. A rendered chapter is an <iframe> with its own
 * browsing context, and a drag over one delivers dragover/drop to the frame — so
 * without a transparent layer over each pane, a book could not be dropped onto
 * the page it is meant to replace, which is the middle of the target. The shield
 * exists only while a row is actually being dragged (TabsService.draggingDocument)
 * so nothing else in the app ever has a sheet of glass over it, and the preview
 * rectangle inside it is `pointer-events: none` — a preview that took the pointer
 * would take the dragover events the preview is computed from.
 *
 * THE STRIP SITS ABOVE THE SHIELD (z-index 31 against 30) and it has to: the
 * shield covers the whole pane, and a strip underneath it could not be dropped
 * on — which is the one drop target a tab drag most obviously means.
