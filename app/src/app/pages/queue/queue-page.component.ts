/**
 * THE QUEUE PAGE — the whole board, with room to breathe.
 *
 * Owen asked for it in the same breath as the bar (his ruling is quoted in full
 * at the head of `QueueBarComponent`): *"put a button in it for 'more info'
 * thatll take me to a queue page that looks like bookforge's queue page"*. So
 * this is BookForge's queue page's ANATOMY, drawn with Foundry's facts and in
 * Foundry's tokens — its structures reproduced, none of its code imported, and
 * nothing invented that this app's queue does not really know.
 *
 * ── The bands, in BookForge's own order ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   Needs you    — failures, with the engine's own sentence. Not drawn when
 *                  there are none, which is almost always, and therefore worth
 *                  reading when it is.
 *   On the bench — the three slots, always all three, occupied or free. This is
 *                  the page's centre of gravity, and the reason the page exists
 *                  at all: rationing one GPU slot and two CPU slots is the whole
 *                  job of the scheduler, and the dropdown has room to group rows
 *                  by lane but not to draw the slots themselves.
 *   Up next      — everything waiting, GROUPED BY BOOK, each row saying why it
 *                  is still.
 *   Finished     — today's work as history, in a table, rather than as more rows
 *                  that look live.
 *
 * A band with nothing in it is not drawn, so the page is short when the queue is
 * quiet and long only when there is genuinely that much to say.
 *
 * ── It is a bigger window onto the same facts, and nothing more ─────────────
 *
 * Every signal on this page comes from `QueueViewService`, which is the same
 * service the dropdown reads — BookForge's own lesson, learned the hard way and
 * written into its page's header: before it had one, its two queue surfaces
 * *"spoke different dialects"* and its page showed a step only once it had
 * started. There is one description of this queue and one set of words for it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * BookForge's page carries covers, ETAs, card temperatures, per-stage bars, a
 * Pause-the-engine control, a Retry, and a per-book Start. Foundry's queue knows
 * none of those things, and a page that drew a slot for an ETA it cannot compute
 * would be furniture that never fills. Two are worth naming rather than merely
 * omitting:
 *
 *   NO RETRY on a failed row. Nothing in main re-runs a settled job; the honest
 *   gesture is to order the work again from the tool that ordered it, and a
 *   button here promising otherwise would be a door onto nothing.
 *
 *   NO PER-BOOK START, though the grouping invites one. `queue.start()` releases
 *   the WHOLE held batch — that is the engine-level semantics Owen fenced off —
 *   so a Start under one title would silently start four other books. The one
 *   Start there is stays in the page head, carrying the count of what it
 *   commits, exactly as it does in the dropdown.
 *
 * ── Hosted, this page cannot be reached ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The route itself refuses hosted (`app.routes.ts`), which is the real gate; the
 * `@if` below is the second half of the same rule, kept for the reason the
 * shelf's summons and the shelf's render were both gated: a door with nobody
 * behind it and a room with no door are two halves of one promise, and neither
 * side should have to trust the other to remember it.
