/**
 * The shell: the open-documents panel on the left, whatever route is open in the
 * middle, the inspector on the right, and the tool dock along the BOTTOM — with
 * the queue shelf floating over all of it and the dialogs over everything.
 *
 * THE DOCK MOVED OFF THE LEFT EDGE. It was an 88-pixel column beside a
 * 220-pixel document list, so 308 pixels of a window whose whole job is showing
 * pages were furniture before a book began. Along the bottom it costs about 58
 * pixels of height, which no page needs, and the width goes back to the
 * documents. The z-index ladder is untouched by the move (viewer < shield 30 <
 * rail 40 < shelf 900 < dialogs 1200): the dock is a flex row rather than a
 * floating bar, so it overlaps nothing, and the one thing that DID overlap it —
 * the shelf's pill, fixed at the bottom right — lifts itself by the dock's own
 * height token.
 *
 * BOTH SIDE PANELS ARE IN THE SHELL AND NOT IN THE WORKSPACE PAGE, because
 * neither is a fact about a route: the lists stay up on Settings, and clicking a
 * row there navigates back to the workspace on its way to showing the document.
 * The documents panel is hidden outright while nothing is open, so Home keeps
 * the whole window it has always had rather than opening beside 220 pixels of an
 * empty list. It collapses to a 30-pixel stub whose only content is the button
 * in the window's top-left corner — the same toggle Ctrl+B and the dock's
 * Documents item press, so the panel has three ways in and the button is never
 * the one that hides itself. The inspector is up whenever the focused document
 * is an unpacked book, which is the only state it has anything to say in.
 *
 * The DROP TARGET is the whole window rather than the viewer, because a person
 * dropping a book at the app is not aiming at a rectangle — and because with an
 * <iframe> filling the centre, the PDF plugin would eat a drop aimed there.
 *
 * ── The keyboard ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Ctrl/Cmd+S, Ctrl/Cmd+W, Ctrl/Cmd+\ and Ctrl/Cmd+B are MENU items
 * (electron/main.ts) and arrive here as `menu:action`: a menu accelerator and a
 * keydown listener for the same chord both fire, and only the menu is
 * discoverable. Splitting is on the menu for exactly that reason — with one pane
 * open there is nothing on screen that says a second is possible, so the View
 * menu is where a person finds out — and the documents panel is there because a
 * panel you have hidden leaves nothing on screen to bring it back except the
 * rail. Ctrl/Cmd+Tab is handled here because a menu item labelled "Next tab" is
 * noise, Ctrl/Cmd+1…5 because a menu of five "Focus pane N" items is five items
 * of noise, and Escape because a dialog that will not dismiss on Escape is a
 * dialog people learn to avoid opening.
