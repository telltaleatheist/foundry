/**
 * The shell: the LIBRARY SIDEBAR on the left — the tree above, the tool dock
 * pinned to its foot — whatever route is open in the middle, and the inspector
 * on the right, with the queue chip in the top row, its panel hanging under
 * that over the page, and the dialogs over everything.
 *
 * AND, ABOVE ALL OF THAT, A ROW THAT IS USUALLY NOT THERE. The host status chip
 * is the one surface in this window's chrome that belongs to the application
 * Foundry is mounted inside: it says what that application is doing, in that
 * application's own words, and it is drawn at all only while somebody is
 * pushing one (`HostStatusComponent`). Standalone the row has no height, no
 * padding and no element — the chip's own host is display:none — so the window
 * this app opens for itself is unchanged in every pixel.
 *
 * THE DOCK HAS BEEN IN THREE PLACES AND IS IN THE SIDEBAR NOW. It began as an
 * 88-pixel column on the left beside a 220-pixel document list — 308 pixels of a
 * window whose whole job is showing pages, furniture before a book began — and
 * moved to a row along the bottom, where it cost about 58 pixels of height that
 * no page needed. Owen moved it a second time (2026-08-17 22:30): *"lets move
 * the nav rail buttons to the left side, pinned to the bottom of the tree
 * sidebar. the tree can be pinned to the top, and if it extends past available
 * space… the user can scroll down to see more of the tree."*
 *
 * SO THE WINDOW IS ONE ROW AGAIN and the buttons cost no height at all: they sit
 * under a tree that was already there, in a panel that was already that wide.
 * What the bottom row bought — a dock as wide as the window — is also what it
 * cost, because the tree beside it kept growing and the two were spending the
 * same screen. The z-index ladder is untouched by either move (viewer < queue 900 <
 * dialogs 1200): the action menu is inside a flex column now and overlaps
 * nothing. The rung once belonged to a pill docked in the bottom-right corner;
 * it belongs to the queue bar and its dropdown now (Wave 43), unchanged in height.
 * (There was a rung at 30 for the workspace's drag SHIELD, a sheet of glass over
 * every pane so a book could be dropped onto an <iframe>; it went with the panes
 * — docs/PLAN.md §4, unit 8b.)
 *
 * BOTH SIDE PANELS ARE IN THE SHELL AND NOT IN THE WORKSPACE PAGE, because
 * neither is a fact about a route: the lists stay up on Settings, and clicking a
 * row there navigates back to the workspace on its way to showing the document.
 * The documents panel is hidden outright while nothing is open, so Home keeps
 * the whole window it has always had rather than opening beside 220 pixels of an
 * empty list. It collapses to a 30-pixel stub whose only content is the button
 * in the window's top-left corner — the same toggle Ctrl+B and the action
 * menu's Documents row press, so the panel has three ways in and the button is never
 * the one that hides itself. The inspector is up whenever the focused document
 * is an unpacked book, which is the only state it has anything to say in.
 *
 * The DROP TARGET is the whole window rather than the viewer, because a person
 * dropping a book at the app is not aiming at a rectangle — and because with an
 * <iframe> filling the centre, the PDF plugin would eat a drop aimed there.
 *
 * ── The keyboard ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Ctrl/Cmd+S, Ctrl/Cmd+W and Ctrl/Cmd+B are MENU items (electron/main.ts) and
 * arrive here as `menu:action`: a menu accelerator and a keydown listener for the
 * same chord both fire, and only the menu is discoverable. The documents panel is
 * there because a panel you have hidden leaves nothing on screen to bring it back
 * except the rail. Ctrl/Cmd+Tab is handled here because a menu item labelled
 * "Next tab" is noise, and Escape because a dialog that will not dismiss on
 * Escape is a dialog people learn to avoid opening.
 *
 * CTRL+\ AND CTRL+1…5 ARE NOT HERE ANY MORE. The first was View → Split right —
 * on the menu precisely because a single-column workspace had nothing on screen
 * saying a second column was possible — and the second focused one of the five.
 * Both addressed columns, and there are none: one viewer, one document (ruling
 * 2026-08-17, quoted in full in `StageService`'s header).

        THE TOP ROW, AND IT BELONGS TO WHOEVER IS RUNNING THIS APP.

        The window has the OS's own title bar and nothing of its own under it,
        which was right for as long as everything on screen was about the book.
        Hosted, it is not: the host runs a queue this app knows nothing about,
        and in the host's own windows that queue's state is in the top corner
        where a glance finds it. So the shell's column grows a first row for it,
        pinned to the right where a status belongs, above everything that is
        about a document.

        IT COSTS THE STANDALONE APP NOTHING AND NOT NEARLY NOTHING. The chip's
        host element is display:none until a host pushes something, and its
        padding is on that same element, so this row occupies no pixels at all
        in a window nobody mounted (see the component). Inside the flex column
        rather than fixed over it, deliberately: a chip floating at z-index over
        the inspector would be furniture nobody could move off the panel it
        landed on, and this is chrome, not an overlay.

        AND THE OTHER OCCUPANT OF THAT CORNER, which is this app's OWN queue.

        Owen, 2026-08-22, verbatim: *"can you make the queue shelf a bar along
        the top right that i can click and look at"*. So the queue is a chip in
        the top row now — a glance, a dropdown under it, and a page behind its
        More info button (\`QueueBarComponent\` carries the ruling in full and
        the gravestone for the shelf it replaces).

        THE TWO CHIPS CANNOT COLLIDE, and it is by construction rather than by
        arrangement: the host's chip is drawn only while a host is pushing a
        status, and this one is not rendered hosted at all. Each is the corner's
        whole content in exactly the world the other is absent from. Two rows in
        the column rather than one shared row, because they are two components
        with two visibility rules and a shared row would be a third rule to keep
        in step with both.

          THE LEFT SIDEBAR IS PERMANENT CHROME NOW, and that is Owen's sixth
          ruling arriving rather than a change of mind about empty panels. It
          used to be drawn only when there was something to LIST — *"an empty
          list is 220 pixels of nothing taken off Home"* — and the dock's
          buttons lived in a row along the bottom of the window. The buttons are
          inside this panel now, so an unrendered sidebar would be an app with
          no Settings, no Home and no Documents button on the one screen it
          opens on. The justification inverted with the contents: a panel
          holding the app's tools is not nothing.

          Collapsed it is a 30px stub — the reopen button at the top, the tools
          icon-only at the bottom — so putting the library away never puts the
          dock away with it. The class is set HERE, on the element the shell's

        should be toasts, hit on a multi-line capture refusal drawn as a band

        THE BAR WAS MOUNTED IN THE WORKSPACE PAGE, which was a smaller mistake
        hiding inside the big one: a notice is about the WINDOW, not about a
        route, and half the writers of the signal — the action menu, the library
        panel, the queue panel's Save… — can be pressed with Settings on screen.
        Every one of those sentences was raised into a component that was not
        rendered, and vanished without ever being drawn. Here it is a sibling of
        the queue bar and the dialogs, which is what it always was in kind: chrome
        over the whole window, alive on every route.

  /**
   * Ctrl/Cmd+Z, and the one decision that has to be made out here.
   *
   * THERE ARE TWO UNDOS IN THIS WINDOW and the chord means whichever one the
   * caret is in. A text box — a rename input in the inspector, a settings field,
   * a paragraph being retyped on the sheet — has the browser's own history and
   * expects to keep it; that is what `role: 'undo'` used to give it, and taking it
   * away so the book could have the chord would have made typing worse to make
   * editing better. So a text field gets `execCommand`, which is exactly what the
   * role menu did, and everything else goes to the book viewer's stack. (There
   * were three while a chapter could be typed into an iframe this window could not
   * see a caret in; that frame is deleted — docs/RENDERER.md §7.)
   *
   * `execCommand` is deprecated and there is no replacement for programmatic
   * undo of a text field. It is what the platform still implements, and the
   * alternative is a chord that does nothing in a textarea.
   *
   * THE DOCUMENT IS RESOLVED HERE AND HANDED DOWN. `BookStacksService` sits at
   * the bottom of the service chain (docs/PLAN.md §4, unit 8c) and knows about a
   * map keyed by tab id and nothing else; "what is in front of the user" is the
   * stage's question. So the chord's raiser asks the stage and passes the answer,
   * which is the same shape the routing always had — it is only that the two
   * halves now live in the two services that own them. Null is legitimate and
   * gets its own sentence: the chord arrived over Home.

   * ── Why this is at the window and not in the grid ──────────────────────────

   * The grid HAS a drop strip, and it was not enough: it is a strip down one

   * empty state, the header — fell past it to this handler and was offered to

   *
   * The fix is not a bigger rectangle. This handler exists precisely because
   * "dropping a book at the app is not aiming at a rectangle" (the docblock
   * above), and photographs deserve the same: WITH A CAPTURE PROJECT IN FRONT,
   * a file dropped anywhere in the window means intake. The strip stays, so the
   * gesture still has somewhere obvious to aim if somebody wants to.
   *
   * Read from the FRONT TAB rather than from the router or a mode flag, because
   * the front tab is the thing a person believes they are dropping onto — and
   * it is the same fact `dropSays` puts on the veil.

     * ── THE MIXED DROP, SORTED BY WHAT THE FILE IS ───────────────────────────
     *
     * Owen (2026-08-22): *"the drop zone on the home page - lets have it accept
     * images (HEIC, PNG, JPG, etc) as input, not just PDF. if the user
     * drag/drops images into the home screen, it pulls them all up in the
     * organizer"*. A drop is not one kind of thing — somebody selecting a
     * folder's worth of a book can easily hand over a PDF and forty
     * photographs in one gesture — so the files are SORTED rather than the drop
     * being classified. A PDF or an EPUB goes through the document door it has
     * always gone through, one tab each; an image goes to the intake workspace,
     * all of them together, because a pile is what the workspace is for.
     *
     * ── WHY THE SEAM IS HERE AND NOT ON HOME'S RECTANGLE ─────────────────────
     *
     * Home HAS a drop target and it is decorative in the strict sense — the
     * whole window takes the drop, and the rectangle exists so that anybody
     * knows that (HomeComponent's docblock, and this class's). Hanging the
     * workspace off that element would rebuild the exact failure the capture
     * front-tab routing was written to fix: a strip down one side of the light
     * table, with every drop that missed it falling through to the document
     * admission and coming back as "IMG_0238.HEIC is not something Foundry
     * opens". A person dropping photographs at this app is not aiming at a
     * rectangle either.
     *
     * ── AND IT IS NOT GATED ON HOME BEING ON SCREEN ──────────────────────────
     *
     * The workspace lives in the library sidebar, which is permanent chrome on
     * every route. So the rule is about the FILE, not about what is in front of
     * it: an image is never a document this app can open, and with no capture
     * project in front there is exactly one useful thing to do with one. Gating
     * on the route would mean the same gesture, one second apart, either
     * organised a shoot or raised a refusal — and the refusal is what it used
     * to raise, which is what Owen was ending.
     *
     * HOSTED, THERE IS NO WORKSPACE and images fall through to the document
     * door as they always did: `available` is the one place that decides it
     * (`IntakeWorkspaceService`), for the reason "Photograph a book…" is behind
     * the same guard — a project born here would land in a library the host is
     * not keeping.
