/**
 * Adopt a Crucible release: fetch the two vendored tarballs, repin, relink, prove it.
 *
 *   node tools/adopt-crucible-release.js 0.6.8
 *   node tools/adopt-crucible-release.js --newest
 *   node tools/adopt-crucible-release.js --check        # what is pinned, and what is newest
 *
 * ADOPTING A RELEASE USED TO BE FOUR EDITS AND A DOWNLOAD, done by hand, and the
 * places do not look alike: two `file:vendor/...tgz` dependency lines that name
 * the version inside a filename, two `//crucible-*` prose keys that name it in a
 * sentence, two tarballs to fetch and two to delete. Miss the prose and the
 * package still installs — it just describes a release it is not pinned to,
 * which is the failure `tools/test-crucible-install-seam.js` was written for
 * after it happened.
 *
 * THE VERSION IS NEVER TYPED TWICE HERE. Everything downstream of the tarballs
 * derives from the tarballs: `electron/crucible/install.ts` exports
 * `CRUCIBLE_RELEASE` as the vendored bootstrap's own `BOOTSTRAP_VERSION`, so
 * once the right bytes are in `vendor/` the app cannot disagree with them about
 * what it pinned. That is also how this script CHECKS itself at the end — it
 * asks the freshly installed package its version rather than trusting that the
 * download went to the right filename.
 *
 * It works unchanged in Foundry, whose package.json is `app/package.json` and
 * whose prose key is `_crucibleClientNote`. Both are found rather than assumed.
 * It is `.mjs` for the same reason: BookForge's package.json has no `type`, so a
 * `.js` file there is CommonJS, while Foundry's says `"type": "module"`, so the
 * same bytes under the same name would be ESM. One file that must run in both
 * cannot be ambiguous about which it is.
 *
 * Nothing here is reversible by itself: it edits package.json, deletes the old
 * tarballs and runs `npm install`. It is all inside the repo, so `git checkout`
 * undoes it, but --check first is free.
